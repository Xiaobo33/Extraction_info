5.0,harald wydras umfassende neue monographie stellt eine machtvolle attacke auf einige allgemeinplätze der heutigen westlichen transformationsforschung dar das buch erscheint aus diesem und einigen anderen gründen als eine der wichtigsten jüngsten beiträge zur internationalen demokratieforschung und müsste sich daher über kurz oder lang zu einem standardwerk zumindest den osteuropastudien entwickeln wydra problematisiert hier das verhältnis zwischen demokratie und kommunismus auf innovative weise teil 1 stellt er die erfahrungsgrundlage experiential basis von kommunismus und demokratie dar teil 2 widmet sich kritischen ereignissen und deren symbolisierung und ist unterteilt die themen bolschewistische machtergreifung kalter krieg die artikulation von dissens und der kollaps des kommunismus teil 3 betrachtet demokratie als einen prozess von bedeutungsformierung meaningformation und konzentriert sich auf die macht der erinnerung den kommunismus als gescheiterte zukunft sowie demokratie als zivilisierenden prozessbr wydra repliziert hier nicht nochmals die weitgehend konsensualen interpretationsschemen für die jüngsten umbrüche osteuropa sondern thematisiert die verschiedenen lücken und ungereimtheiten diesen erklärungsansätzen vor allem stellt er den auf strukturelle veränderungen fixierten demokratietheorien eine alternative konzipierung der entstehungsgründe für demokratische praktiken entgegen gemäß wydras interpretation spielen bei der auflösung autoritärer regimes und entstehung polyarchischer handlungsmodi mein begriff die konkreten historischen erfahrungsschätze der beteiligten akteure insbesondere deren lehren aus früheren versuchten und erfolgten gewaltvollen umstürzen und revolutionen eine rolle demnach ist demokratie nicht nur ein resultat sozioökonomischer entwicklungen und deren rückwirkungen auf die machtstruktur vielmehr waren die gegebenheiten der kommunistischen regimes unter anderem der widerspruch zwischen deren verwendung einer pseudodemokratischen legitimationsstrategie auf der einen seite und dem nichtsdestoweniger häufigen rückgriff auf physische gewalt zur machtsicherung auf der anderen seite letztlich dafür verantwortlich dass sich eine von toleranz gewaltfreiheit und idealismus geprägte und damit moralisch überlegene dissidentenbewegung herausbilden konnte wydras interpretation betont die schleichende unterwanderung der logik des kommunistischen systems durch gesellschaftliche kräfte deren entwicklung dieses system selbst förderte er bringt unter anderem die motive und intentionen der handelnden akteure bei den regimewechseln insbesondere die spezifika der politischen alternativkultur unter den dissidenten als wichtigen faktor für die untergrabung der legitimität der existierenden machtverhältnisse ins spiel und betont die rolle individueller erfahrungen für den konkreten ablauf und das ergebnis der transformationen,positive
