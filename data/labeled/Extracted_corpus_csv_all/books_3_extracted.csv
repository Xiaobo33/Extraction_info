5.0,harald wydras umfassende neue monographie stellt eine machtvolle attacke auf einige allgemeinplätze der heutigen westlichen transformationsforschung dar das buch erscheint aus diesem und einigen anderen gründen als eine der wichtigsten jüngsten beiträge zur internationalen demokratieforschung und müsste sich daher über kurz oder lang zu einem standardwerk zumindest den osteuropastudien entwickeln wydra problematisiert hier das verhältnis zwischen demokratie und kommunismus auf innovative weise teil 1 stellt er die erfahrungsgrundlage experiential basis von kommunismus und demokratie dar teil 2 widmet sich kritischen ereignissen und deren symbolisierung und ist unterteilt die themen bolschewistische machtergreifung kalter krieg die artikulation von dissens und der kollaps des kommunismus teil 3 betrachtet demokratie als einen prozess von bedeutungsformierung meaningformation und konzentriert sich auf die macht der erinnerung den kommunismus als gescheiterte zukunft sowie demokratie als zivilisierenden prozessbr wydra repliziert hier nicht nochmals die weitgehend konsensualen interpretationsschemen für die jüngsten umbrüche osteuropa sondern thematisiert die verschiedenen lücken und ungereimtheiten diesen erklärungsansätzen vor allem stellt er den auf strukturelle veränderungen fixierten demokratietheorien eine alternative konzipierung der entstehungsgründe für demokratische praktiken entgegen gemäß wydras interpretation spielen bei der auflösung autoritärer regimes und entstehung polyarchischer handlungsmodi mein begriff die konkreten historischen erfahrungsschätze der beteiligten akteure insbesondere deren lehren aus früheren versuchten und erfolgten gewaltvollen umstürzen und revolutionen eine rolle demnach ist demokratie nicht nur ein resultat sozioökonomischer entwicklungen und deren rückwirkungen auf die machtstruktur vielmehr waren die gegebenheiten der kommunistischen regimes unter anderem der widerspruch zwischen deren verwendung einer pseudodemokratischen legitimationsstrategie auf der einen seite und dem nichtsdestoweniger häufigen rückgriff auf physische gewalt zur machtsicherung auf der anderen seite letztlich dafür verantwortlich dass sich eine von toleranz gewaltfreiheit und idealismus geprägte und damit moralisch überlegene dissidentenbewegung herausbilden konnte wydras interpretation betont die schleichende unterwanderung der logik des kommunistischen systems durch gesellschaftliche kräfte deren entwicklung dieses system selbst förderte er bringt unter anderem die motive und intentionen der handelnden akteure bei den regimewechseln insbesondere die spezifika der politischen alternativkultur unter den dissidenten als wichtigen faktor für die untergrabung der legitimität der existierenden machtverhältnisse ins spiel und betont die rolle individueller erfahrungen für den konkreten ablauf und das ergebnis der transformationen,positive

brilliantly crafted series resonated younger demographic characters could personally identify even added abnormalities wings superpowers excitement always alltime high lightning fast narrative fascinating plot kept reader guessing became hallmark series personally unnerving anxiety instilled sensation hunted like nothing id ever read sense menace always present making wonder would happen next would get max would keep family misfits together patterson accomplished still wrapping series essence fun adventure array emotions made feel simply captivated flocks pursuit freedom answers great stuffbr br painful know lot people series went downhill badly original trilogy fugitives theyre called maximum ride best excellently written set novels followed group mutant children escape people created ask maximum ride series ended patterson left stone unturned plotthread loose make sequel would feel natural unfortunately case wrote remainder series patterson wanted end high note third novel continued series due large demand consumers result maximum ride final warning liberal propaganda book children massive smack face fans shift direction bad day regard book one worst existence rest following novels ranged decent passable yet none could ever even hope bring back magic original trilogy personally feel posttrilogy books lacked sense direction storytelling meaning patterson didnt clear idea wanted take characters story envisioned series one cohesive trilogy something feel authors never clearly continued series knew people wanted maximum ride books result shouldnt given us wanted say authors make books envision stop giving public demands end product simply speaks selfdefeating went nevermore optimism would solid conclusion venerable series ups downs unfortunately nevermore set let lot promise unfortunately didnt pull throughbr br describing plot nevermore actually quite difficult without spoiling like majority series books dont clear goal objective central crisis didnt appear far even synopsis back book doesnt provide clear picture besides glorifying sake avoiding spoilers lets say plot involves new interest fang white coats doomsday plan worlds population recovering angel seriously couldnt help feeling hint déjà vu sense patterson running motions wrote books plot felt like retreading prior elements series rescuing angel umpteenth time genocidal cult like previous book didnt feel like final chapter rather like jumping hoops lacked sense direction storytellingbr br dont mean completely bash book defense patterson actually things right really helped bring hint old magic back original trilogy one stopped treating flock celebrities political activists sole purpose forcing environmentalist schlock childrens throats route incredibly pretentious one pattersons behalf made characters instantly less interesting relatable let children grow make decisions life politics keep entertainment say patterson right return series roots incorporating slice life meaning flock longer worlds spotlight rather simple things like attending school trying act like normal people really brought back innocent nature previous books four seven completely lacked biggest failing original trilogy ended lack proper villain sense menace series longer antagonist could challenge flock pose legitimate threat contributed greatly aforementioned sense chased original trilogy without spoiling person ill say patterson bring back worthy opposition flock albeit lazy fashion notice said hint old magic older books elements hitting stride theyre unceremoniously removed narrative actually prepared grade book higher two patterson completely nixed elements set disappointmentbr br patterson attempt bring back elements early books also brought negative aspects newer ones nevermore first surprise dylan absolutely hate love triangles time theyre worthless theyre nothing pretentious way make innocent romance feel incredibly contrived moment patterson introduced dylan series never thought second max would ever choose fang dont perceive character rather obstacle max fang overcome theres fangs gang group outcast mutant children recruited selfimposed exile previous book like dylan never cared new additions time theyre given absolutely closure became even jarring particularly interesting plot twist reared left completely unresolved cant take characters completely abandon middle book kill wish least give closurebr br expected finale popular series theres going outcry faction fans dislike conclusion plot various characters kinds things inevitable unfortunately one vocal fans ending disappointing makes zero sense matter way look like im disadvantage cant fully explain flawed ending without spoiling refuse though im sure theres going plenty spoilerfilled reviews follow precede mine newfound threat endangers earth comes literally nowhere opposed malefactor explained mere moments ago making supposedly books major threat feel like red herring something else thats never explained worst completely destroys mean destroys supposed grand destiny max patterson building past five years disappointing unfulfilling worst doesnt correlate events supposed transpire felt like patterson ran ideas made completely asinine finale said happy theres endingbr br trust say really wanted like nevermore hoping deep patterson would send series
