{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Your's in the ranks of death", "text": "I discovered Ann Radcliffe's 'The Italian', like another reviewer, after having read 'The Monk'. And while I had hoped for another similarly twisting, winding, gothic thriller, this was not the case with 'The Italian'.<br /><br />The opening pages seem to purport the reveal of the tale of the Black Penitents, as the story opens with a group of travelers seeing a shadowy, diabolical figure lurking in the shadows of a church.<br /><br />But what follows is more of a tale of 'star-crossed lovers', leaning a bit more toward Romeo and Juliette. Vivaldi, the hero of this tale, pursues the affections of the orphaned Ellena Di Rosalba, much to the chagrin of his mother, the Marchesa Vivaldi. She employs the aide of her confessor, Father Schedoni, to separate the young lovers.<br /><br />Ellena is spirited away to a convent, which Vivaldi breaks her out of, and here the tale becomes at least a bit more complex, as Vivaldi is subsequently imprisoned for his actions; as Ellena is marked for death in her new surroundings; and the Marchesa struggles to keep them forever apart.<br /><br />In comparison to 'The Monk', which you find in Amazon's list of 'people who read this book also read' listing...this tale is in no way as dark, gothic, or 'thrilling' a read. Though enjoyable, the story doesn't fit the opening pages and the foreshadowing of the 'diabolical figure' seeking refuge in the church to avoid death, the mysterious 'Black Penitents' named...or any of the intrigue with which the book opens.<br /><br />Still, in comparison to modern 'thrillers'; this book is paced well, plotted nicely, and comes to a logical conclusion. While I did not find the story I anticipated, it is still worth a read.", "images": [], "asin": "0140437541", "parent_asin": "0140437541", "user_id": "AFDO4CMGQWESUVRQM3N7JH2YNHCA", "timestamp": 1116768045000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

I now wish that I had followed the negative reviews.  Almost immediately it seemed that Mr. Lehrer was stretching various scientific evidence and theories very thin to match up to his thesis that some artists predicted scientific breakthroughs (such as Proust).  I tried to dismiss these instances as artistic fancy, but when the author including information about DNA that is 10 to 15 years out-of-date and flat out wrong, I just could not continue.  If Mr. Lehrer is going to compare hard science with art then he should have researched the fields about which he writes, or had better fact-checking of the book.<br /><br />I ultimately quit this book because while I read a lot about science, and was able to cross-check that things in this book were wrong according to what experts in the field have written, I am not a scientist nor am I a literary scholar.  If Mr. Lehrer is misrepresenting, lying, or simply so bad at science writing that he is giving me bad information, how am I to know?  Long story short: Mr. Lehrer lost my trust.

Then when the hoopla died down and I got to actually read court transcripts and realized the lack of foundation for the state's claim, I re-thought my position and the research began.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not recommended", "text": "Ay ay ay. Karl Ove, what a disappointment.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to reading this book. I read Motherhood, and Babies in this series, and enjoyed both very much. When I read that Karl is known for his honest writing, and was criticized for it, I thought \"yes! Just up my alley then.\"<br /><br />But no. This book was boring, and did not shed any light on \"fatherhood\". It was a series of events that took place to Karl himself, where he found every opportunity to complain about his kids or wife or other people's kids and wives. It held no insight, but to convey to readers what a pain \"fatherhood\" actually is, and how he sees it as a distraction from all his writing and reading and socializing.<br /><br />Fatherhood is basically a book written by a grumpy middle-aged man, who finds his kids to be a nuisance most of the time. There were very few, and by few, I mean I can count them on one hand, instances where he discusses a topic that I had actually considered or worried about as a parent. Such as when his kid's teacher recommended a speech therapist because she was behind in her speech development.<br /><br />Again, those instances are rare and for such a small book, it was really disappointing to read long, boring passages of a father whining about being a father.", "images": [], "asin": "1784872660", "parent_asin": "1784872660", "user_id": "AHY52ST2HDGRLL5HZTHBLPPDKPXA", "timestamp": 1546407586594, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Top Hat Treat", "text": "He was easily among the most lauded mystery novelists of the 1930s and counted both Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers among his many fans--but today John Dickson Carr's novels are, with a very few exceptions, no longer widely read.  This is something of a shame, for at his best Carr's work is second to none, and it would prove tremendously influential for decades to come.<br /><br />Called in to investigate the theft of a rare manuscript from collector Sir William Bitton, larger-than-life detective Dr. Gideon Fell is greatly amused to find London agog over \"The Mad Hatter\"--a prankster who steals the hats of the rich and famous from their very heads.  But when Bitton's nephew is found dead inside the Tower of London with a stolen hat on his head, Fell's interest quickly turns from manuscripts to murder.<br /><br />Although it is expertly written and shows his talent for both sly humor and memorable atmosphere, THE MAD HATTER MYSTERY is not really among Carr's finest works--largely because the plot unfolds through interviews with and interrogations.  Instead of reading about what the characters, we read about what they say they did.  To further complicate the matter, Carr presents his novel in \"real time,\" following Fell and his companions as they ferret out the truth over the course of a very long day.  It is an interesting concept, and one that later writers (including Ngaio Marsh) would borrow with great success, but in this instance it feels slightly artificial.<br /><br />Even so, in terms of the mystery itself Carr keeps the reader guessing right up to the very end, and I recommend the novel as a pleasant way to pass a few hours--and certainly one could do far worse than select THE MAD HATTER MYSTERY as an introduction to Carr's work.  While it may not be first rank, it is certainly top hat all the way.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "images": [], "asin": "0060809973", "parent_asin": "0060809973", "user_id": "AEIMW2BKNTFJK7NFEWHVASC4LEYA", "timestamp": 1099632577000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": false}

Unable to move from terror she stares at the robber who's mask is in the downed customers hand. He points and shoots. Shelby wakes up in the store with a gun shot that luckily just grazed her head.

It is sometimes hard to read, that being the contextual connections with what he writes. Yet at the same time, we learn that MOS is often reduced to mental anxiety and physical cruelty. What makes his account the more fascinating is not the means, delivery or regularity of his being brutalized, but what we learn about the guards and his interrogators and the other peripheral parts of his captivity. He reads what he can, watches an occasional movie and gets into discussion about religion with his captors. Those are the high points, to be sure, not forgetting the long stretches of depravity.<br /><br />Larry Siems, who edited MOS's diary, does his best at explaining what we are missing from the text.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Lovely relationship btw Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode. What about the other one?", "text": "Very interesting, well written, I liked the style, amusing at times, Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode are a very fun couple, and I really enjoyed their interactions... But I also had a hard time with some of the plot, including the &#34;probable&#34; lesbian relationship between Idgie and Ruth. PLEASE DON'T IMMEDIATELY SLAM ME AS &#34;HOMOPHOBIC&#34; FOR STATING THAT. This is largely a question of realism... and a lack of exploration of an important subject while the two characters are opening up to each other...not the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of Idgie and Ruth's relationship. I had a very hard time believing that absolutely everyone in a small, backwards town with the kind of bigotry depicted against others due to race and gender, the KKK, sexism... (themes which are openly explored) would be so entirely accepting of a woman who so completely refused to be \u201cfeminine\u201d and a lesbian relationship (again, not explored whatsoever). It made me feel like it was... fiction. For example, the older Mrs. Threadgoode touts her Christianity at times in her conversations with Evelyn. Most Christians in the 20s, 30s\u2014up to today!-- were very against any homosexual relationships. (Ruth taught Sunday school. In such a town in the 20s, how many people would allow a known lesbian to teach Sunday school?) Is Mrs. Threadgoode clueless, or accepting? This is never remotely explored. And where does the tolerance for homosexuality go when Idgie, of all people, confronts Ruth\u2019s son Stump on needing to marry a girl? Is this how she would have approached him, knowing full well that, if he has not been interested in women so far, he could be a homosexual himself? No, apparently she forces him to go have sex with a woman. Odd. This is not the only part of the book that made me feel the pages under my fingers. As a minor example, the fact that one can easily have trainers bring elephants to a town just because some resident feels like it made me it happen as well.<br />If Ms. Flagg is bringing in the \u201cn\u201d word, or the cursing of the young man running out the market, gory details of certain stuff, or more explicit descriptions of the sexual relationships of Ruth and Evelyn, it\u2019s presumably to add to the plot AND to make the book more realistic. But then I think Ms. Flagg left a giant invisible elephant in the room when facing the relationship between Idgie and Ruth, something she presented pretty blatantly in the &#34;historical&#34; part of the novel, but then dropped completely in the &#34;present&#34; portion. If the two main characters are opening up to each other so thoroughly why leave something so important hanging? So, alas, some characters stayed on the pages... I found the book enjoyable, but unfortunately not realistic.", "images": [], "asin": "0449911357", "parent_asin": "0449911357", "user_id": "AHPH6TGXFVCQZ55QMU3CYUNHVKQA", "timestamp": 1416234817000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Making \"Ordinary Time\" Extraordinary", "text": "Poised to become a collector's item, this book is written with the objective of letting readers appreciate Ordinary Time using good literature and prayer guides. The 29 weeks of readings are designed for use during the period from Pentecost to Advent. Readings such as prayer guides, meditative readings, provoking thoughts and literary masterpieces, are compiled from writers, philosophers, theologians, from the Early Church to the modern era. Arthur has selected the pieces that tend to focus on helping readers to be worshipful in the reading, meditative on the praying, and to cultivate a more reflective and contemplative mood in a society often thought to be busy, distracting, and downright confusing. She calls the anthology a kind of \"moonlit garden\" to invite readers to walk the long Ordinary Time period, traversing the full range of spiritual experiences \"from conviction to calling, quarreling to awakening, dark nights, redemption, and everything in between.\" The title of each week's readings is a good reference point on where the author is attempting to invite into. Each week follows a similar structure. There is an opening prayer and Scriptures to be read. There are choice readings from various writers and poets, most of them considered classics or masters of spirituality. There are opportunities to pray and reflect upon the readings. At the end of it all, there is a closing prayer, chosen from some of the best worshipful prose and poems.<br /><br />I am also amazed by the huge collection of materials that dovetail so well into the theme of each week. Arthur brings together the different writers from different eras, selects their literary pieces, and let them speak for themselves. At the same time, she lets them converse with one another through the minds of the reader. One can read slowly or pace steadily. One can also select a few to read at a time, or to read one large passage in a single sitting. Some of the readings are intentionally brief so that the words are given time to sink in and to initiate ripples of creative thoughts. Many of the writings are from 15th to 21st Centuries. There are the Medieval spiritual writers such as Teresa of Avila, St John of the Cross, Julian of Norwich, John Donne, and St Francis of Assisi. There are famous 17th to 19th Century writers such as Madam Guyon, George Herbert, Christina Rossetti, Richard Baxter, and Leo Tolstoy. The modern era is also well represented with familiar names like CS Lewis, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Luci Shaw, Frederick Buechner, Wendell Berry, Chiam Potok, Mary Oliver, Marilynne Robinson, and many more. With such a collection of well-known writers and the high quality pieces, readers are often challenged to remain at the \"still point,\" to reflect upon life. They are invited to ponder the words and the powerful imagery it paints. They are persuaded not to let the world around us mold us into its hurried and non-stop busyness frame of mind. Instead, the reflective reading and contemplative praying is an antidote that helps us move into an unhurried disposition, and a readiness to stop or pause every once in a while without feeling guilty about it.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly for people who wants to be refreshed in their prayer life, for people who desire opportunities to reflect upon life in God through the most ordinary of circumstances, for those who want to be more contemplative as they live day to day, meet person to person, and to let the book accompany them as they progress through a spectrum of emotions.<br /><br />If you are planning to go on a spiritual retreat, and wonder what you need to bring, let me recommend at least three things. First, bring a Bible. Second, carry along a hymnal or a book of spiritual songs. This book is a strong recommendation for the third. It is that good.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars of 5.<br /><br />conrade<br />This book is provided to me free by Paraclete Press without any obligation for a positive review.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Battle in Africa, Salerno, Anzio, the south of France & the Bulge.", "text": "This battalion started its existence as 2/503rd Para. It was sent to England and somehow remained distinct from its regiment. It became progressively 2/509th and then the independent 509th. As the only airborne unit on hand for the invasion of North Africa, it was the first US unit to make combat jumps. The science of these was still in its infancy, so there were a host of problems. Nonetheless, a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude showed the capabilities of airborne forces.<br /><br />The battalion\u2019s real baptism of fire though came in Italy, with a drop to support the Salerno landings. Like what happened later in Normandy, the force was scattered widely but served a purpose in the overall disruption they caused. An even more epic action followed at Anzio where the 509th served as elite infantry. They then went to France, dropping in support of the Anvil/Dragoon landings. Their actions chasing the German units withdrawing to Italy are the first I have ever read about this campaign. Finally, the battalion is rushed to the Ardennes to help stop the German\u2019s massive assault there, where it is decimated and then disbanded.<br /><br />It is quite a storied journey by the end. I hadn\u2019t realised the extent to which the 509th was involved in such key battles. The casualty list is very extensive by the end. Yet there was great value in the work that it did. The 509th developed practices that were adopted by the broader US airborne service. It never disgraced itself and like many of the US airborne units consistently outfought larger, better armed German forces. The author reveals its history very well. This is done partly through the memories of a number of the veterans. I\u2019d have liked more here but it is adequate.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Extreme Lit 101", "text": "How do you review something like this? Perhaps it would best to start out by saying Vincenzo Bilof is not a new author to me. I have read a number of his books and they are all unique. He isn't the type of writer who plays by the rules. His style can be difficult for some especially if they are looking for the more linear variety that stays on a plot and doesn't try to push your button every other paragraph. I have enjoyed his work but i have also been critical, suggesting that he doesn't always seem in control of this writing, barreling forward sometimes faster than his words can follow his mind. But whatever he writes, he is never boring, never safe, always challenging and damn! Does he make me pay attention and think!<br /><br />The Violators is his best novel to date. It is also his more offensive and shocking, and that is saying a lot. The novel centers on a young student named Alan who is accepted into a class titled The Art of Contemporary Literature. He soon finds himself in the company of a professor and his students who believe the pathway to understanding literature is through murder, debasement and torture. Doctor Julian Krang has a strong hold on them as they murder innocents and their classmates. Yet Alan's responsibility in this new class seems to be to destroy the students and the professor. He is an unwilling participant yet is reluctantly attracted to the idea and to one particular girl who encourages him in his role as destroyer.<br /><br />Despite its strange and somewhat repulsive idea, it is a simple plot. The telling of it is anything from simple. Bilof uses pretty much every trick in his literary arsenal to write what is mainly a dark satire of the contemporary literary world. There are a lot of references and in-jokes for anyone who is aware of the independent publishing field, especially those doing Bizarro. Unless one is intimate with the Bizarro genre, most of them will go over their head. However, The author disperses plenty of clever allusions to more mainstream influences raging from Lovecraft to an especially funny dig at Harlan Ellison. Bilof is in many ways writing as much for the writer as for the reader. Yet Bilof's main influences in this experiment seems to comes from more esteemed crazies. The nihilism of Chuck Palahniuk and the slacker desperation of Bret Easton Ellis is all over this book. We know this because the author broadcasts it, mentioning the authors often and thus even parodying the idea of influences. It is a clever and perverse ploy that confronts the person that enjoys finding the inner influences, like me, with the idea that you are going right where the author wants you to go. An influence that isn't broadcasted seems to be Italo Calvino who, in If On a Winter's Night a Traveler, does a similar trick by telling a story while letting you know the author's intention and how it affects the reader's perception. And if you want another possible influence, I believe the Marquis de Sade is doing more than lurking in a corner.<br /><br />Manipulation does seem to be a key theme here. Krang is a manipulator par excellence. He enjoys the power as much as he enjoy making others think they have the power and taking it away. It can be said all writers are manipulators and Krang and his proteges, and by projection the author, know both reality and literature are defined by perception and manipulation. This is a book about extremes. It blasts too many taboos and boundaries to mention. Yet it is Bilof's exceptional prose that keeps the reader enthralled through the madness. As Alan enters the classroom for the first time we are instantly teleported into a stark mentality by paragraphs like this...<br /><br />  &#34;A classroom without decoration, without windows. A classroom plucked from a maximum security prison. Chairs and desks bolted to the floor. A dusty desk in the front of the class with nothing on it not even a textbook or a calendar or a computer. A blackboard with chalk smudges and penis graffiti, a mushroomhead spraying semen-drops into chalk oblivion.&#34;<br /><br />There's a lot of backstory and monologue through the novel. They not only provide more insight to these unlikable protagonists but also gives a philosophical base, albeit a nihilistic one, to wrap the story in. Yet it all become a blaze of fog and confusion at some point. If the point of the author is to make you uncomfortable and unstable, to throw you into a soup of intellectual despair, he succeeds well. Personally I like the feeling of instability. It tells me that i can be challenged and that reading isn't always just a spectator sport. In many ways, despite the grotesque themes and manic writing,this may be his most accessible work. It is grounded in the real world unlike many of his other novels whose bizarre science fiction/alternate universes battle with the unconventionality of the writing and structure. The Violators is one of those books I recommend very carefully. It is not for everyone and I am sure you realized that by now. But it is important especially if you want to see the extremes that art can take you for better or worse. If nothing else you can be thankful that this extreme is between the pages of a book and not within a classroom with bolted down desks and penis graffiti on the walls.", "images": [], "asin": "1943720029", "parent_asin": "1943720029", "user_id": "AHHZUWJ46I3LI3JOIZRJYQNBBMJQ", "timestamp": 1458800880000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Best Book of The Royal Brides Trilogy", "text": "Of the 3 book in the Royal Brides trilogy, I felt this one was the best and most realistic.<br /><br />When we meet Therese and Claudio, they have already been married for a while. Claudio, next in line to the throne, chose Therese as his bride as he felt she had all the necessary attributes to be the future queen and even had her fertility tested so make sure that she could provide him with an heir. Their's was a marriage of compatibility, not of love. But over the years, Therese comes to realize that she has in fact fallen in love with her husband.<br /><br />Claudio decides that it's time for them to start trying for a baby so Therese goes off the Pill. But heavy bleeding and intense pain gets her a diagnosis of endometriosis which has rendered her infertile. The endometriosis also makes sex painful so she starts turning Claudio down when he wants sex. Knowing her diagnosis will mean the end of her marriage, she puts off telling Claudio. In the meantime, Claudio begins to suspect the reason his wife has been turning him down is because she has found someone else. Between the decrease sex life, her zoning out, and the fact that he realizes that she no longer loves him, in his mind, he has been usurped by another man.<br /><br />Claudio's treatment of Therese when she asks for a divorce was actually hard to read. My heart went out to her. But then Claudio finds out the reason for her request and insists than they stay married. But Therese is insistent, especially after she witnesses the way her brothers-in-law treat their wives, she knows Claudio does not love her and believes he only wants to remain married out of misplaced duty.<br /><br />As with most Harlequins, there is a lot of miscommunication and missed meeting of the minds. My one (and I think only) problem with this book is Claudio's about face. One minute he doesn't love her and the next minute he is desperately trying to convince Therese of his love. I'm glad she didn't believe him. I wouldn't either. The same thing happened to Marcello and Danette (in His Royal Love Child - 2nd book in the trilogy). In both instances I felt as if there was something missing, as if the editor cut out some important paragraphs to fit the word count and messed up the story. You can't have a 180 degree change of heart in the blink of an eye and expect to be taken seriously.<br /><br />However, his capitultion really was touching, and the book had a sweet ending.", "images": [], "asin": "0373125488", "parent_asin": "0373125488", "user_id": "AEPAECDAWBCJVG3SKO52VMYDCQ2Q", "timestamp": 1313533056000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Outstanding book", "text": "This book was originally recommended to me by a Marine who thought I might be interested in the story of General Ray Smith and his opposition to women in Combat. What I found in the book about his courage and that of General Marty Steele and Jim Jones made it hard to put down.<br /><br />Although all three men deserve our respect for their service to our country I will always hold General Ray Smith in the highest regard for his integrity. He showed unbelievable physical courage on the battlefield and outstanding moral courage off of it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was the story of General Smith's interview with the Secretary of the Navy for the possibility of getting his third star. Before entering the room he was wisely advised about a \"grenade\" question: \"What do you think about women in combat?\" He was then counseled, by his good friend Marty Steele, on how to politically skirt the issue. To his credit Smith entered the room \"loaded for bear\" and left the room with his hopes for a third star gone and his career ultimately terminated.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Neither Fish Nor Fowl", "text": "\"Bad Intentions\" is the newest installment in Karin Fossum's Inspector Sejer series.  The author is Norwegian; the book would therefore be classified as a Scandinavian mystery/police procedural. It follows on the 2009 THE WATER'S EDGE, in the same series, in which it is her seventh.  And it should be a welcome find to those readers who are just discovering Scandinavian mysteries in the wake of the late Steig Larsson and his Millennium Trilogy.<br /><br />In this book, Inspector Konrad Sejer and his partner Skarre are faced with the finding of the corpses of two young men in local lakes.<br /><br />The first victim, Jon Moreno, had been sent a year earlier to Ladegarden, a psychiatric hospital, after a nervous breakdown, caused by a mysterious burden of guilt. He was now supposedly getting better, according to his psychiatrist Hanna Wigert and his new friend at the hospital, Molly Gram. He is spending a summer weekend in a rural lakeside cabin with his two oldest friends, who came to pick him up at the hospital: Axel Frimann and Philip Reilly. So, when he drowns in Dead Water Lake, Sejer hesitates to call it a suicide.<br /><br />Then another corpse is found in Glitter Lake, that of a friendless young Vietnamese immigrant, Kim Van Chau. Their mothers are distraught; Sejer promises to solve the cases, which he is sure are connected.<br /><br />Fossum's work has been widely admired by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, and praised by such authors as Ruth Rendell and Colin Dexter, writer of the Inspector Morse series.  The Norwegian author's novel THE INDIAN BRIDE won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for mystery/thriller.  There's no question but that she's a skilled, imaginative writer. This is the first of her books that I've read, but I find it answers the description of the body of her work: bleak psychological thrillers.  It certainly was offbeat and original.  However, I was a bit puzzled by this book; much of what happens occurs offstage, it substantially lacks the characteristics I have come to identify as those of Scandinavian crime novels,and I don't know that I'd consider it properly a murder mystery.

The antique look of this journal seems to make it feel even more personal. Like something I've had for many years. But in a good way. The color combination happens to be one of my favorite.

I was looking for a blank canvas type of journal. One that could just be written in, with no prompts or fancy quotes throughout. I already have a journal like that.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mostly Backgrounds, Not Many Images To Color", "text": "I love the cover, it's got a rubbery feel to it...better than just a standard glossy front page like most coloring books. This gives it some quality and makes it stand out as a higher end coloring book, in my opinion.<br /><br />The coloring book itself is just okay. My impression was that most of the pages were going to be like the front cover page, consisting of an actual humorous image to color. Out of the whole book, only about 6-7 are imaged coloring pages. The rest consist of phrases with mandala-type background's (random shapes, etc) to color.<br /><br />In addition, on almost all the pages, the words are solid black...so you cannot color the phrases themselves, just the backgrounds of the phrase.<br /><br />Now on to the phrases themselves: I did not like most of them. They are stereotypical, and some of them I found a little offensive. They poke fun at dads, some referred to overweight dads, beer bellies, alcohol consumption, etc. I personally have never been a big fan of stereo typically making fun of fathers that exhibits them as lazy, fat, useless, etc.<br /><br />This wouldn't be something I would gift to my own husband or loved one, but if you nor the father that you purchase this for have a problem with these types of slightly negative phrases, then it would be a good book for you.<br /><br />It's a cute idea, I would just prefer a different version, and more actual imaged coloring pages.

The only fly in the ointment \u2026 she hasn\u2019t been there a year and she has been at the center of three murder investigations.

Although it has diminished, racism has by no means vanished and it may well be resurging in our society that is increasingly diverse and polarized.  Sammy Davis speaks personally and honestly of the racial attacks coming at him from both white and black societies, beginning with his childhood in Harlem through the Civil Rights era when he was one of the most loved and highest paid entertainers in the world.<br /><br />Burt Boyar's uncanny excellence as a writer leaves one marveling at how any author is able to capture such depth of emotion using another man's voice.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "fast-paced and deftly-told", "text": "Davi Rhii is a prince of the Boralian people and a newly-minted military officer, but he's about to find he's much more than that. After discovering his roots as the son of Workers (people on another world enslaved by the Boralians), he is forced to decide to which side to support--and is drawn into a solar-system-spanning battle for freedom. Along the way, he has to face down his own entrenched cultural assumptions, and finds a new faith by embracing the one God of the Workers.<br /><br />Bryan Thomas Schmidt's debut novel is a fast-paced and deftly-told space opera adventure set in a well-envisoned political and social environment. It is classic space adventure in all the right ways, with plenty of action, twists, and characters with emotional depth.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice tarot deck", "text": "The Wizards Tarot by Corrine Kenner, published April 2014 by Llewellyn Worldwide, is an exquisitely beautiful tarot deck illustrated with digital artwork by John J. Blumen. This deck and accompanying eighty page booklet will take you on a journey into Mandrake Academy where you will learn from the instructors of the Major Arcana the lessons of magic. You will also learn the four elemental school from the minor Arcana. This tarot deck is based on the Rider-Waite system so it is easy to use.<br />In the eighty page booklet we are introduced to the cards and while reading about each card we are taught little lessons such as how amulets are worn for protection and typically made of stone while talismans are made from metal and worn for luck. Also, in the back we are given a three card spread called, \u201cThe Empress\u2019s Garden Spread\u201d.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this deck and its\u2019 instructors. I think that the idea is a good one. I do wish the accompanying booklet taught us a bit more but it is good to learn some very basic things. I think that the 242 page handbook included with the first version of this deck would be useful for this version as well and wish that it was included with the newer version. Overall, this is a wonderful tarot deck and would be a great addition to any practitioners collection with its beautiful artistry and ideas.<br /><br />I acknowledge that I received a copy of this deck for free from Llewellyn Worldwide in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion of it.", "images": [], "asin": "0738739383", "parent_asin": "0738739383", "user_id": "AEEQ6FELFF4KIOXKAYXANQHFNMBQ", "timestamp": 1396915157000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Andy Stanley takes you on a journey through the stories in the Bible, beginning with creation, and shows you that God's grace has always abounded in every situation since the beginning.<br /><br />This book is written in such a way that you will find yourself relating to every story, every situation, and every subject. It is encouraging, reaffirming, reassuring, and life-changing. You will weep as the words strike a chord in your own heart and rejoice as you realize that grace is a product of God's deep and everlasting love for all His children. You will learn that as He extends his grace to you, so should you extend grace to your neighbor. You will see the very nature of God spilled out onto every page; how His grace extends so far beyond our own reach and limited depth perception. You will see that He is a graceful and merciful God; the message is abundantly clear and unmistakable.<br /><br />I highly recommend putting this book at the very top of your must-read list.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "An introduction to sustainability", "text": "\"Sustainability separates us from nature and envisions us 'getting by' by limiting our negative environmental impacts over the long term. Sustaining involves scarcity and minimalism; by contrast, thriving involves abundance and enrichment,\" says Andres Edwards in Thriving Beyond Sustainability. To illustrate \"thriveability\", the author has selected examples of sustainability initiatives from around the world that demonstrate what he calls SPIRALS principles: scalable, placemaking, intergenerational, resilient, accessible, life affirming, and self-care.<br /><br />This is a good general introduction to the people and organizations that have tried to advance sustainability around the world in the last two decades. If you are just getting into this field and trying to figure out what is going on and how you might get involved, this is the book for you. The chapters are organized by categories of sustainability initiatives, such as municipal climate action plans, greening commerce, regenerative design, and saving ecosystems. It provides an overview of the important movements and concepts in sustainability over the last few decades, such as New Urbanism, carbon cap-and-trade, ecosystem services, conservation hotspots, extended producer responsibility, biophilic design, and so forth. It also introduces you to the people and organizations that have pioneered these movements. As such it is an excellent reference book and the list of resources at the end is very helpful. The book would be appropriate for an Intro to Sustainability course.<br /><br />However, it does not go deep into any of the initiatives and is not critical of them. A lot of the initiatives cited are small or nascent and doubtful whether they make a significant impact for sustainability. For example, the author cites the creation of the Millennium Clock, a clock that cuckoos once a millennium, as an example of long term thinking. I rather doubt that this innovation makes a significant difference for sustainability. Noticeably absent is a discussion of politics and the (lack of) political action that would benefit the environment (except at the local level, where there are more success stories). Instead the book is focused mainly on individual and organizational initiatives. Because so much of the content is about current initiatives, the book will quickly become outdated. Today when I looked up one of the organizations that the book cited as doing important work to connect people around sustainability, I found out that the organization is going out of business.<br /><br />Overall this is a good reference book and a starting point from where one could do more research to learn about the issues. But it is not a philosophical discussion of the direction we are headed and what might be needed to create a thriveable world.", "images": [], "asin": "B003UESN1Q", "parent_asin": "B003UESN1Q", "user_id": "AFWHXVZT5OLVJPO2GJNPH5A6D3KA", "timestamp": 1396370691000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

With everything going on right now, let's be honest, life is freaking hard! It's easier than ever to get consumed by dread, doubt, uncertainty, fear... especially being cooped up all day at home, and having less room to connect with myself because I'm jumping from zoom to zoom to zoom. Melody's book is different from all the other self care and self growth books I have on my bookshelf in two very special ways: 1) it captures both my heart and my mind and 2) it is easy to take in small doses. I usually get so overwhelmed by self growth books that having dense chapter upon dense chapter with exercises that take up so much time that I don't have. I also am both a super emotional and logical person, and not everything out there grabs both my heart and mind. Melody's book is the perfect solution to all of this. You can turn to a page and on the right side read a beautiful, emotional, passionate love letter that gets your heart pumping and your imagination spinning. Then turn your attention to the left page and and get the same poem translated to logic, something that your brain can ANCHOR to as your imagination spins. It's an incredible experience, and I look forward to having this book as my little sidekick in the months to come.

Sequel, please!", "text": "If you ever wanted to read an extraordinarily riveting novel---action-filled and tender by turns-- while learning what it was like to live in England during the Cromwell years, don\u2019t miss Ann Swinfen\u2019s latest novel Flood, set during the seventeenth century in the remote fenlands of East Anglia!  Under Cromwell, joyless Puritan fanaticism reigns with a focus on witch-hunting and destruction of beautiful centuries-old churches, not to mention the emergence of a corrupt government that turns a deaf ear to the reasonable concerns of citizens seeking redress for wrongs.  Against this background, the plot, suspenseful and exciting, pits entitled land-owners against the disastrous encroachments of unscrupulous speculators ignorant of the environmental consequences of their actions.  The lovely descriptions of the fenlands are elegantly written with an eye for detail that transports the reader to a ready understanding of its need for salvation. The characters are unforgettable.  The reader becomes immersed in their lives, seen through the eyes of the novel\u2019s strong heroine Mercy Bennington as she navigates the hair-raising twists and turns of her struggles and challenges as the story progresses.  In some respects this is a coming of age story about Mercy---wise for her years, grounded in love and loyalty for family, friends, and the fenlands themselves.  As Mercy matures, the love that develops between her and Gideon becomes increasingly important to the brilliantly conceived plot.<br />I literally could not put this novel down.

Her decision to write a YA novel at the height of the genre\u2019s popularity seems to be a terrible idea, however, the result is a book that tells a somewhat saccharine and sentimental story that uncovers a masterful writer. Palacio executes incredible characterization through a variety of independently vivid portrayals of narrators that are members of a community embracing an unusual child who may seem to be an outsider, but who enters everyone\u2019s hearts as they open to him.<br /><br />I read this book on weekends with my eleven-year-old over a span of nine months. He enjoyed listening to it at bedtime, and the short chapters along with the various narrators taking the steering wheel throughout the novel allowed for this sporadic reading schedule over a long timeframe. I will say that the sentimentality the novel depends on, in terms of my sensibilities as a reader, somewhat took advantage of my patience. However, my eleven-year-old loved it, and I expected this going into it. Regardless of how Palacio takes advantage of the audience\u2019s patience, it is a pretty sweet story that prompted many conversations with my son about doing the right thing and accepting everyone for their character...

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Aslan's Glorious Appearing", "text": "I thought it timely, in light of the controversy surrounding another \"End Times\" story, to remark on this most remarkable of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles.  This satisfying series conclusion illustrates Lewis' brilliant analysis of Biblical prophesy in a touching story children of God can all look to with anticipation (\"...Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.\" Rev. 22:20b).<br />This is the story of Armaggedon; the conflict between anti-Christ (anti-Aslan) and the great masses of inhabitants of lost Narnia deceived by him and doomed for eternity versus the ultimate salvation of the few true followers of Aslan to eternal life in His Country, the True Narnia.  The allegory to Scriptural truth is remarkable as illustrated by this most insightful, genius mind of modern-day Christian apologists.<br />The high point of the story occurs after the destruction of the old world and the lost souls who rejected Aslan, who are dispatched allegorically in Revelations 20, \"lake of fire\" fashion.  The heroes of the story, including all the key players from the earlier Chronicles, are seen trying out their new \"resurrection\" bodies exploring the most beautiful place ever imagined, thrilled to have Aslan with them.  They find after a while that the beautiful country is actually Narnia, the REAL Narnia.  Though the Narnia they knew and loved was perceived most wonderful, it was a mere shadow of the perfect New Narnia, the one that would last forever, always with Him present and providing all the light in the never-ending Day.<br />For believers in Christ, Lewis has projected a clear picture mortal minds can comprehend of how it might be on that Day.  It is shown through a children's story because that is how we must come to Him; like a child.  \"You must become just like a child to enter the Kingdom of God\".  Jesus said \"let all the little children come to Me\".  In Narnia, those child-like believers were never lost once they found Him, by His grace.  Those who perished were the lovers of the old, decaying, temporary Narnia and were deceived by what their own wills commanded, rejecting and hating Aslan and worshipping the god of their chosing, their own selves.  This is a definitive picture of our fallen world and our fallen culture.  Lewis' work is prescient in describing the condition of the world of today, one in which Jesus could return to at any time, as our prayer pleads from Revelation cited above (but if He tarries, one and all can be sure that He is coming soon; \"soon\" defined as the lifespan of the individual).<br />One last point on a most poignant scene from the story.  It involves the fierce young Tarkaan warrior Emeth, devoted follower of the vulture-like god of the Calormens, Tash.  As our heroes are exploring the Real Narnia, following Aslan \"further in and further up\", they discover this unlikely believer sitting perplexed under a tree, \"surprised by joy\".  Emeth's story is one that demonstrates man's frequent inability to match his rational and correct thoughts with his often erroneous mental images of said correct thought.  In this case this child of the Light lived bravely demonstrating the fruits of the Spirit in humility, submission and obedience to the true God of everything, the Self-Existant Great I AM.  But his human error was in his vision of what God looked like and not knowing His correct name.  Emeth is somewhat like Helen Keller, who, when \"told\" about Jesus by Anne Sullivan in the eternal darkness, quiet and aloneness of her disability, said \"so that's His name; I know Him\".<br />The story of Emeth's salvation by grace is much akin to the salvation of the thief on the cross, or like mine.  It doesn't say that \"being good\" gets one into Heaven, as one mistaken reviewer opined.  It does show that a totally surrendered heart turned toward the One true living God in obedience and love will not be turned away, no matter how mistaken one's mental images may be about God. It is a beautiful picture of salvation by faith through His grace and not by works.  God does all the saving; the Holy Spirit teaches us about the true nature of God by His perfect, inerrant Word.  Lewis' picture of Emeth is one all believers should take heart in, realizing it is not our purview to know who God has saved by His sovereign will.  Of course, Emeth's works demonstrated his salvation, even though he was not recognized as a believer.<br />Emeth's conviction, humility and devotion in this passage continues to bring me to tears.  As Aslan seeks him out in the New Narnia, Emeth is convinced he is about to die.  He has seen Aslan in His Glorious Appearing and is convicted of his sins.  He falls at His feet thinking \"Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honor) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen Him.\"  Read the book to see a most beautiful prosaic illustration of Christ's mercy and grace.<br />This is an ideal book to read either before or after reading the last of the Left Behind series, Glorious Appearing.  The stories are very similar with the same outcome and the same great Hope.  The self-possessed \"intellectuals\" of the world may guffaw at those who believe in \"Whom\" Lewis and other Christians have assurance.  Most of these \"intellectuals\" are ignorant of Scripture, though some are over-studied yet deluded by their self-enlightenment, hard hearts or pride (see 2 Corinthians 4:4, 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 for the bottom line, or if you can't get translation from that source, try reading Lewis' definitive study Miracles).<br />The Chronicles of Narnia are reading for a lifetime.  They should be read by believers as a reminder of how we are to come into His presence.  In Narnia we see the joys of serving Him in the trials and in the triumphs of this life.  In The Last Battle we see the Genius of Revelation as given to Lewis on a plain that even great intellects can embrace if they are willing to \"not harden their hearts\" (Hebrews 3:12-15).  If they are not willing they will get a clear picture of the consequences.", "images": [], "asin": "006447108X", "parent_asin": "006447108X", "user_id": "AFTL27E3CG3SY36OFK2TN6M6EATA", "timestamp": 1085263194000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Mostly Filler", "text": "This book attempts to position itself as a reference for both the home cook and the professional, and unfortunately fails to serve either market. At first glance, the book appears to be a slick, well-designed volume typical of the CIA's other books. Upon closer inspection, however, it appears that the polish is only skin deep. In fact, it appears that a large portion of the material is purely filler, serving no real purpose and providing no useful information. The book goes so far as to include seven pages of content attempting to describe the flavors of various herbs and spices. I can't imagine that anyone in this book's target audience needs a paragraph describing the flavor of basil, nor are any of the passages specific to charcuterie: it appears to be a copy-and-paste job from some other reference. There are numerous tables in the book that serve no purpose: an \"herb and spice chart,\" a sugar temperature chart for making candies, page after page of metric-to-imperial conversion charts (all recipes in the book are given in both, as usual for the CIA series), etc. It has all the appearance of material added to boost the page count.<br /><br />The book contains a large amount of food safety information, some useful and some not. The extensive listing and description of the various possible bacterial infections is interesting in an academic sense, but contains little practical information other than \"prevent cross-contamination,\" \"cook everything to death,\" and \"chill quickly.\" It spends pages on trichnosis, although it is now exceedingly rare in the US and easily mitigated against. And there, at the very end, is a single paragraph on \"harmful molds in sausages,\" an area crucial to understanding the production of dry-cured items. It contains no actual useful information, simply instructing you to use a mold inhibitor to prevent its growth. The remainder of the chapter is a copy-and-paste job from every other Food Production Safety 101 textbook on the planet. I would hope that at a culinary school a course like that would be a prerequisite for entry into a charcuterie class: no need for it here.<br /><br />The chapter on forcemeats is large and well-illustrated, but covers exactly the same material as [[ASIN:0470055901 Garde Manger: The Art and Craft of the Cold Kitchen (Culinary Institute of America)]] (the CIA seems to have a real fascination with terrines... 50 pages worth seems excessive to me when that material is almost completely duplicated from another book in the series). The chapter on sausages (70 pages) contains some useful checklists for sausage production, and a nice discussion of the various types of casing. The recipes included are uninspiring, however, and there is virtually no coverage of dry- and semi-dry sausages: a few recipes and a few cursory comments, but no useful, practical advice, despite their prominent placement on the cover. If you are interested in dry-cured sausage this book provides virtually no useful information. They finish up with a quite extensive chapter on condiments, which seems to be a standard in charcuterie books.<br /><br />If you are new to charcuterie (either as a professional or a home cook) I strongly recommend purchasing Ruhlman and Polcyn's [[ASIN:0393058298 Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing]]: it provides and excellent foundation, and while not as \"slick\" as the present volume, is far more readable, and properly emphasizes things like temperature control when mixing, and a realistic view of food safety and cooking temperatures. If your interest is in terrines, I'd then add the CIA's [[ASIN:0470055901 Garde Manger: The Art and Craft of the Cold Kitchen (Culinary Institute of America)]] (which I should note also contains quite a bit of charcuterie information which overlaps with Art of Charcuterie). If your interest is in dry-curing, I recommend Marianski's [[ASIN:0982426712 The Art of Making Fermented Sausages]]---it is not very well written, but it contains a goldmine of information in excellent detail: exactly what Art of Charcuterie is missing. Finally, there are a number of books that include more interesting recipe ideas than either this volume or Ruhlman and Polcyn's book (which focuses on classics): [[ASIN:0982426720 Polish Sausages, Authentic Recipes And Instructions]], [[ASIN:1580081592 Bruce Aidells's Complete Sausage Book : Recipes from America's Premium Sausage Maker]], and [[ASIN:0025668609 Great Sausage Recipes and Meat Curing]].<br /><br />The upshot is obviously that this book presents nothing new, nor does it present anything particularly well.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />* Useful checklists in the production sections<br />* Good production values<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />* Poor presentation and organization of the material<br />* Uninspiring, uninspired recipe collection<br />* Missing critical details in many aspects of production<br />* Not well-written<br />* Mostly filler (insert sodium tripolyphosphate joke here)", "images": [], "asin": "0470197412", "parent_asin": "0470197412", "user_id": "AHGNJKZSIGGT4UBE5H7NEKBEJ2GQ", "timestamp": 1291998836000, "helpful_vote": 170, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Why feelings are as important as reasonings", "text": "We all have feelings. (Turgenev said that 'everything depends on them'.) They can grab our attention in surprising and commanding ways. We can see them as imposing themselves on us, as being alien to us, as being something we have to rationalise away. We don't design to have feelings - although some feelings are immensely pleasurable. So why do we have these extensions of simple sensory awareness?<br /><br />In this book we learn that the feelings - or emotional responses - are things that we should honour in ourselves. These are immediate responses to our environment and they way it affects our view of how we sustain ourselves in the face of challenges. When we face a problem we can be rational about it - look at options, look at strengths and weaknesses, look at possible outcomes to different courses of action. But at the outset we will have an emotional response that tells us what our immediate assessment is. This emotional response is as important as any other form of evaluation.<br /><br />Nussbaum uses emotionally evocative materials to demonstrate her points of view - music, literature and poetry. This is very effective and avoids losing the drive of her thesis in philosophy, psychology, psychoanalysis and the like. I was not convinced in this when she talked of Mahler's music, but her discussion of Mahler's use of words was very revealing to me.<br /><br />There is philosophy in this book - lots of it. And, for me, that was far more to my liking that large anmounts of psychology might have been. I was fascinated by the discussion on compassion - is it real or an invention? For me it is real, but following the arguments philosophers and schools of philosophy have made was very instructive. I was perhaps less convinced about the ascent of love. Maybe this was psychology interfering. For me sex and love have to be separated. This is difficult because sexual activity is generally associated with the trust that genuine love creates. But, of course, this is not a necessary outcome. Most of the people we love we do not have sexual activity with. Don't even want to have sexual activity with. So to embed the ascent of love with sex does seem to me to be making two distinct matters unnecessarily entwined and probably to the detriment of the understanding of both.<br /><br />It took quite a while for me to read this book. But, despite its closely argued structure, it was not a labour.", "images": [], "asin": "0521531829", "parent_asin": "0521531829", "user_id": "AFFJ3Z6NXDM2YEW6QBVVEYA3Q3FQ", "timestamp": 1114989535000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "\"The English are never in error. At least, that's what they tell me.\"", "text": "A historical murder mystery with a touch of the paranormal; it is apart of the Charles Patterson mysteries. A seemingly open-and-shut case, with a girl murdering most of her family to escape back to London, quickly becomes tangled upon investigation.<br /><br />To begin with, I have not read the other Charles Patterson mysteries. I still found the novel enjoyable, but would recommend others to begin with the first book. How the Patterson universe works in relation to other worlds and spirits for example, took me by surprise but was still simple enough to follow. The chapters also started with amusing lines from letters between two, unknown to me, characters.<br /><br />The first chapter is a mere six pages, and it pulls the reader straight into the book with a heavy dose of suspense. Southey does a lovely job at building up the plot, and giving little details so one may try and solve this mystery. Between all the twists and turns the novel takes, it's not obvious who the murderer is but it's still possible to piece it together. The chapters themselves tended to be pretty short, and between that and the suspense the novel read rather quickly. I found this book rather hard to put down, and finished it in one read.<br /><br />On the other hand, I don't particularly like the idea of being able to talk to spirits and ask them to recount events. To me, that seems like cheating. I would have greatly preferred the novel without any jumping between worlds and speaking with the dead.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone interested in a quirky murder mystery.<br /><br />I received a free electronic copy of this book from Severn House.", "images": [], "asin": "1780290179", "parent_asin": "1780290179", "user_id": "AGSPJK7CLECBTENFWKZPUF5KOQBA", "timestamp": 1328676780000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "well written thriller but...", "text": "First, the good. Julia Bartz's The Writing Retreat is exquisitely written and utterly compelling. It is a great winter thriller - a bit of horror, a lot of intrigue, and so much mystery... and my new favorite thing - a book within a book! I literally did not want to put this book down and I kept trying to figure out what the heck was going on with this creepy writing retreat. The author in question, Roza, was just so much EVERYTHING. You never know what you're gonna get with her, and her character really made this story interesting.<br /><br />However... I was really put off by two things. One, this odd sub-plot (really just a mention) of a Jewish woman who falls in love with a Nazi during the Holocaust. Just... no. Why does that have to be part of a book published in 2023? I don't get it. I know you can argue Stockholm Syndrome or whatnot but DO BETTER. That is to the author, the editor, the publisher. This book did not need that, and it's wrong on so many levels.<br /><br />The other thing that bothered me was all the sex content. Mention it, fine. But there were so many weird sex dreams and a long tangent into discussions of sexual orientation/sexual tension. If you want to write that, fine. but that seemed to be a large enough part of the plot that I would have thought it would have been part of the book description. I never would have read this if I had know that there would be multiple chapters devoted to weird sex dreams (some with a demon, no less).  This definitely was on the \"open door\" side of things, and typically those books allude to it in the description, so this caught me off guard.<br /><br />All in all, this book was two things at once - a great, well written thriller but also a bit surprising (and not in a good way), The surprising negative aspects definitely brought the start rating down for me.<br /><br />Thank you to the author, publisher, and NetGalley for this eARC.

Second, and I am a big fan of Bodner's Stephen King-like ability to make every character- no matter how small- a real, breathing person.  Or monster.  Even a pet pig gets a moment in the spotlight, so you can imagine the detail given to the main characters, especially the background of the gay vampire Chris.  This really brought the book alive for me.  Finally, the book was just fun.  Yes, this is horror, and yes, people and pets die in a myriad of horrendous ways, but in the end I smiled when I was reading it and was totally entertained.

Always running. Always looking over her shoulder.\" (Woodhouse,170). Working as a Harvey Girl she discovers a world of  \"women of good  moral characters, manners, loyalty, and work ethic.\" (Woodhouse, 97).  Hoping for a fresh start she begins to carve out a life for herself at the new and popular El Tovar Hotel known for the majestic view of the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Ray Watkins works for his father's business but finds himself quite often balancing the practicing of the 5th commandment in the Bible and his conscience. Ray's father is all about promoting the Watkins name with the goal of it being internationally known.  He hopes to one day use his father's company to help others less fortunate. His path crosses with Emma Grace and he finds himself immediately drawn to her.  While Emma likes Ray she can't help but let her bias against wealthy men cause her to put up walls. She isn't quite sure what to make of Ray because \"he wasn't at all like the other wealthy men she'd known. If she weren't careful, it would be far too easy to get caught up in all his talk of philanthropy. And his blue eyes.\" (Woodhouse, 184).<br /><br />Will Emma's past catch up with her? Will Ray and Emma be able to overcome it and discover a life together?<br /><br />Seeing the growth in Emma and how she comes to a saving faith and that faith actively changing her was one of my favorite parts of A Deep Divide. \" The change that God had done in her was truly amazing...No longer did she feel weighted down.\" (Woodhouse 305-306).  It reminded me as a believer how God transforms our lives.<br /><br />Overall, I thought A Deep Divide was an intriguing story, however there were a few moments where I felt it lagged a bit while trying to create suspense and sometimes focused a little too much on developing theology, instead of building the mystery and suspense.

Ash (Ashoka Mistry), a chubby boy of Indian descent living in England, knows this very well.  He is teased because of his weight, his lunch money is stolen; he feels constantly taunted.  Actually, this is the easy part.  Ash believes that his summer visit with an aunt and uncle in India, accompanied only by his 10 year old sister, Lucky, holds promise.  He is mistaken.<br /><br />The Savage Fortress introduces middle-grade readers to some of the most fascinating Hindu gods and goddesses.  This quick-paced tale features the ultimate bad guy.  Lord Alexander Savage, despite having learned the magic he\u2019s used to live for thousands of years, wants more.  He wants immortality.  His determination to obtain his desire puts him on a quest to find the tomb of Ravana, the demon king.  Savage is more than willing to become the demon king\u2019s slave, in exchange for this small favour.  He is very close now, nothing would dare intervene.  He will not be stopped.<br /><br />It takes only a short while in India for Ash to understand that things are not what they seem.  His uncle\u2019s boss, Lord Savage, seems odd beyond eccentric\u2026\u2026..in a chilling, creepy kind of way.  Savage\u2019s staff is worse.  They seem to stare at Ash and Lucky with eyes of reptiles, birds or furry jungle predators.  Due to the exponentially increasing weirdness, Ash tends to stay as far away from Savage as humanly possible.  Not a great plan.<br /><br />Ash takes a tumble that will change him forever\u2026\u2026\u2026..errrr, at least in this life-time.  Accidentally uncovering the one thing Savage needs to proceed, Ash instantly has the weight of the world on his shoulders.  As he begins to recall past existences, he begins to see things more clearly.<br /><br />The unlikely associates that Ash befriends as he embarks on this journey add a dash of spice to an already hot story.  The internal and external struggles that Ash must face bring in a bittersweet undertone.  This is absolutely one of the best books, particularly for the genre, that I have ever read.

Yeah, I'm glad she leaves it up to the reader to decide, because I decided Charlotte doesn't deserve to win.  She comes across as a strong woman, but just as often turns stupid. Why are fictional women made to look good professionally but then made incapable of handling personal issues? I'm sure we all have days like that, but when one starts doubting Charlotte's capabilities it's difficult to see her being a successful politician. Is Piazza saying that women are just made that way--lacking an innate ability to be strong both professionally and privately?

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "New \"Light\" on the Juarez Murders?", "text": "In doing research on the femicides down in Juarez, I checked out Desert Blood:  The Juarez Murders.  I was especially interested in a writer from the El Paso area, being able to give me a better feel for what was going on down there.  Contrary to the title, much of the book has to do with the main character (author), rather than the actual murders.  To say that the protagonist \"has issues\" is an understatement. Ivon feels so persecuted throughout the story that she does not come off as a particularly sympathetic character, though  perhaps this is to point out that being lesbian in Hispanic culture is especially difficult. It would have been more effective, if the plot had stayed true to the title and focused more on the murders. But make no mistake; although this is fiction, it is a book that has a definite agenda in regard to the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />In an exerpt from a sequel to \"Desert Blood\" which Gaspar de Alba has posted on her own website, Ivon sums up the author's \"insight\" into the Juarez Murders:<br /><br />\"It's about poor, young, Mexican women who are being slaughtered on the border precisely because they are poor, young, and Mexican, and because their bodies pose a threat to the racial economy of white supremacy and, thus, to the national security of the United States.\"<br /><br />Or as Ivon articulates at the end of \"Desert Blood\":  \"What happens if they cross over?  More illegal Mexican women in El Paso means more legal brown babies.  What's the price of free trade?\"<br /><br />Connecting all the dots, NAFTA is blamed for creating jobs on the border for these poor brown women to come and work in, and also as a preemptive anti-immigration measure, murder is used to prevent them from crossing the border to the U.S. illegally. The problem is that these women already have jobs, and NAFTA was promoted in the U.S. as an anti-immigration tool since it would provide more work in Mexico and an incentive to stay there.  As Gaspar de Alba herself says in apparent contradiction:  \"A majority of the victims are poor migrant women from small villages and cities in the interior of Mexico, coming to Ju\u00e1rez not to cross the border but to find a job at a maquiladora.\"  This is extremely tortured logic and isn't it surprising with so many women in the half million maquiladora labor force, that many thousands more are not being killed according to this theory?<br /><br />To understand the Murders in Juarez, you do have to realize how easily these young women become victims as they move north to Juarez with inadequate housing and improper security to protect them as they go to and from work in the early morning or late at night.  For these unsafe conditions along with the social and economic exploitation, NAFTA can be held responsible, but not for some kind of racial geo-politcal masterplan as implied by the author's thesis. As a matter of fact, one of the theories investigators have for the murders is that they are commited by \"unemployed local men, resentful of the women working in the maquiladoras.\" The fact that the victims are poor and also women, has led to the killings being ignored for so long.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \"Desert Blood:  The Juarez Murders\" does not \"shed new light on the murders.\"  In fact, it creates a red herring for the unsuspecting reader.  Why inject a racial motive when there is no evidence that this violence against women stems from anywhere but the local culture?  Such misleading \"information\" even in a work of \"fiction,\" becomes another form of injustice.  It would have been more instructive to examine the changing role of women in Mexican society in the wake of NAFTA and how this may have resulted in gender conflict.  What about  the role of drug cartels and local gangs, serial killers, and the extent to which the official investigation has actually been compromised?  For a more objective account of the true horror of the situation down at the border read \"The Daughters of Juarez\" by Teresa Rodriguez.", "images": [], "asin": "1558855084", "parent_asin": "1558855084", "user_id": "AEDLUHSJE6DHOT6H423YNL44NKTQ", "timestamp": 1263695805000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

I think it's nice that it teaches kids that things may not always be what they seem. Without giving the whole story away, the monster named &#34;Karrit&#34; is just as scared of the girl as she was of him. Once they learn this then they aren't as scared any more. I have a 4 year old daughter and she liked the story with me. I do wish the book was a little longer as it seemed as though we went through it fast. Even though the story is short there is a lot of room for  &#34;making things up&#34; with your child as to what may happen next and so on. This is what we did and it's fun and helps the child with imaginiation. No answer is wrong or right. Overall it's a cute story though and my daughter liked it. I did receive this as a gift.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Tough Assignment", "text": "Author Kyle Mills had a very difficult assignment filling in for Vince Flynn.  For that reason, and being unfamiliar with Mills' other writings, I decided to read, enjoy, and remain non-judgmental about the style comparisons.  The book has a very slow start, one which seemed to purposefully  try to delay writing the life and death situations which ultimately were reported.  Having read each of the Mitch Rapp series, Mitch, in this novel, is portrayed by someone who continues to be conflicted about his past.  In other installments, Mitch seemed to have come to terms with the losses suffered in his personal life.  While I may have missed it in Mitch Rapp's previous adventures,  he never struck me as being so self-invested as to consider taking out a trusted member of his hand-picked team.  Perhaps I am not recalling the details quite correctly but the aftertaste of this book leaves me not liking Mitch nearly as much as before.  And that was a disappointment I would attribute to the writer's style difference with Mr. Flynn.  And even though obviously suspecting a double-cross, atypically, our protagonist failed to install a plan to thwart the antagonist's plan.  Such oversight was definitely not on par with actions I would have expected from Mitch Rapp. And the death of a mother and her innocent child, key figures in  part of the plot, were mentioned as victims only after the fact. The reader barely had the chance to work up a proper emotional rage against the perpetrators.  But judge for yourself; read the book.  It does have some good moments, once the action starts coming.", "images": [], "asin": "B00UDCI7RI", "parent_asin": "B00UDCI7RI", "user_id": "AGES2RDEB2XDZOSKKG45WH7S3JKA", "timestamp": 1447267619000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

The story begins with their meeting and concludes with their eventual conversion to Catholicism.<br /><br />The story is witty, interesting and at times almost unbelievable. Yes, there are ordained ministers who still regard the Catholic Church as the Whore of Babylon; this is one such story of how one man dug deeper, tried to answer questions of conscience and investigated the lack of scriptural foundation for 'sola scriptura', and finally converted.<br /><br />The reader cannot help but feel convinced by Hahn's story, which has all the scripture scholarship of an accomplished rector of a Presbyterian seminary with all the passion for the Holy Catholic Church. By the book's end you may find yourself wondering how anyone could be anything other than Catholic.<br /><br />A great reminder for rusty Catholics, a challenge to the Scripture Alone or Faith Alone theologians and an amazing testimony for anyone pursuing the faith.", "images": [], "asin": "0898704782", "parent_asin": "0898704782", "user_id": "AFKRWET4Y2UC3PPN5DRKFSMH5LJQ", "timestamp": 1180820442000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

Woodson discovers the journal had been written by Gonzalo Guerrero, the first Spaniard to live among the Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula. As Pedro and Woodson translate the document they realize that Guerrero had stumbled onto something that he could not have possibly understood. At first the mystery appeared to be the existence of an ancient lost city. But what Woodson and Pedro discovered was the existence of a rare codex (book) The Fifth Codex and set out to find it!<br /><br />Goodreads Summary<br /><br />This book will interest children, the book is fairly lengthy-roughly 240 pages.  The novel starts off fast-paced and, for the most part, keeps that pace.  The characters are fun to read about.  Pedro is inquisitive, intelligent, and kind.  Richard is nice, adventurous, and interesting.  The characters will hold the readers' attention for the majority of the book. There are excerpts from Guerrero's journal included for the readers' perusal.  The action is tame, but exciting-aimed at a younger age group than \"teen.\"  The ending is perfect for the novel.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "An excellent resource!", "text": "This book should be on every Christian woman\u2019s list of must reads. Glenna Marshall shares her heart and what she has learned in her adult years and as a pastor\u2019s wife on the importance of studying God\u2019s word, praying, and the importance of corporate worship.<br /><br />Marshall dispels the excuses that we use to thwart our daily spiritual disciplines and encourages us to find time to read, memorize, and study God\u2019s word each day.<br /><br />In this book Marshall will define everyday faithfulness and show us what that would look like in different chapters of our lives. She addresses our lack of discipline and gives practical ways to find time for God each day. Her reason for being faithful in the small daily things is that it prepares us for the bigger trials and challenges to come. If we don\u2019t know scripture how can we recall it in the midst of trouble?<br /><br />This book has a great deal of encouragement and she shares scripture to show us that God wants to meet with us each day. The two chapters that impacted me the most were chapters 4 and 6 on waiting and suffering. Her words were a comfort to me in the midst of some trying times in my own life. It was deeply meaningful to me to know I am not alone and that God speaks of these very things in His word.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for your personal reading or to be used with small groups or share with friends and family. It is a very needed book in our world today. As we face uncertain futures, scary health issues, struggles with jobs and family, and the distress we feel each time we open our social media or turn on our television I believe the habits she encourages can give us a secure foundation to handle whatever comes. The most important thing we can do each day is know Christ more.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Some flaws, but overall a really useful book", "text": "The good: the author's room plans actually take into account furniture placement around windows and glass doors as well as entry points. Her examples show REAL homes with odd, mismatched furniture. Clear before and after pictures and floor plans, even if they are in black and white. She has some good rules of thumb to at least think of, which you may or may not agree with, and tends toward the neutral (white/beige) as far as paint--you can always add color with your choice of furnishings and art. She tells you which one should win out between beautiful view and fireplace when you have both in a room.<br /><br />The bad: Most of it is about living rooms, and she apparently assumes that you are doing a  good deal of formal entertaining there. There are virtually no ideas for people who use their living rooms for anything else, e.g. home office, exercise room, playroom, etc. Not everyone entertains in their house--some have backyard BBQs, and others entertain at restaurants or the local park.<br /><br />Where I disagreed with her:  If you have a library of books that you actually use, you would never organize them by size, you would organize them by subject/author, except of course for your truly oversized books. Pillows on sofas--hmmm. I think you can use them on futons or sofas with hard armrests, but on your typical overstuffed sofa, they're overkill. Would rather see a nice handmade afghan.<br /><br />To the critics who were upset that she \"ignored\" the TV: It is an etiquette thing, actually. The TV is not supposed to be more important than your guests, and she is by no means the only decorator who says to hide the TV in an armoire or better yet, put it in another room. These days a lot of the newer homes have dedicated \"home theater\" type rooms, anyway--with a less-expensive alternative being a spare bedroom.<br /><br />Besides, if you're having a Superbowl party or some such TV-related event, it would be smarter to have a TV in the kitchen/family room area where hopefully there is no carpet, and nothing furniture-wise that could be ruined by food.<br /><br />Bottom line: This book has a lot of useful ideas for furniture arranging, geared primarily to the living room and family room, but you can also use them as a jump-off point for rearranging other rooms. Some good ideas for some of the other rooms, like dining rooms you don't use because your kitchen is plenty big enough to eat in.

It seems the \"turn on, tune in, drop out\" hippie/drug culture of the 1960's was replaced in the 1970's by a desire to re-settle in other lands. This conforms to my memory of the era, as I recall friends who used to talk about going to New Zealand, where (it was thought that) the government left people alone. Costa Rica was also mentioned as a good destination, because of its peaceful traditions, and it shows up in the author's narrative in this book.<br /><br />The author does eventually find her way back home.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Reeves writes with passion and compassion about hope", "text": "In this little book, Christopher Reeve principally seeks to show the value of hope. He talks about the surprising progress he made in recovering as a quadriplegic after a terrible accident. (Long after doctors believed recovery was possible, Reeve began to show improved movement.) He also talks at length about the politicization of stem cell research and how that has likely stymied further progress on relieving many human disabilities. Despite his clear feelings on the issue, Reeve is sympathetic to people with deep religious reasons for opposing stem cell research, just not those who do so as political posturing.<br /><br />Along the way, Reeve talks about his brush with Scientology (a fascinating glimpse of a religion that's been so much in the news), his other religious searchings, his initial thoughts of ending his life after his accident, how he and his family have dealt with his quadriplegia, and his work as an advocate for health research.<br /><br />This is a quick and enjoyable read. Reeve's insights on the nature and role of hope will be strengthening to people who struggle with any of a range of issues from physical to emotional to spiritual. Reeve himself reads the unabridged audio CD version; I recommend it.", "images": [], "asin": "0345470737", "parent_asin": "0345470737", "user_id": "AEX6EOFCLO4MKEMEOWRTBY3PGWYA", "timestamp": 1147271914000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Bad Philosophy Meets Bad Biology", "text": "For the most part, worthwhile books about biological science are written not by professors of literature, history or philosophy, but by scientists.  There are, of course, exceptions to this: the works of David Sepkoski, for example, often bring fresh perspectives to the history of biological ideas and to the empirical underpinnings of those ideas.  But it is fair to say that when a historian of science, like Sepkoski, succeeds in such a work, the foundation of that success lies in his thoroughly understanding the scientific work that is his subject.<br /><br />Without an understanding of the underlying science, a work on the philosophy or history of science will be largely useless and likely to miss the mark in a thousand ways, even if it is internally well reasoned and coherently written.  If it is not well reasoned or coherent, it will be even less useful than that.  And that brings us to this book by Neil Thomas.<br /><br />Thomas is a retired instructor whose principal work seems to have been in medieval German literature, with some dabbling in philosophy but never, it appears, in the philosophy of science.  His writing style is a bit stilted at times, and there are passages where it seems that he will not use a single-syllable Anglo-Saxon word when something more extravagant is available.  But that style would be endurable were it not for the fact that his ability to focus upon any particular topic is extremely limited.  This book often seems to skitter chaotically from one subject to another, with no evident linkage between where it's been and where it's going.<br /><br />Like many anti-evolution writers, Thomas directs his attention almost exclusively to Charles Darwin's writings and upon his influences, known or presumed, rather than writing about current evolutionary theory.  Darwin, of course, wrote without the benefit of the last century and a half of empirical research, and without the benefit of improvements not just to the data but to our understanding of biological function, development and heredity.  Any biologist today can identify points on which Darwin was simply wrong, but few will deny the importance of his key insights.  To critique evolutionary theory, one must understand it; and to understand it, one must not just read Darwin and stop there, frozen in time more than a century ago.  This, it seems, is a point Thomas does not appreciate.<br /><br />A good deal, consequently, of his writing about Darwin runs along the line of resurrecting various of his nineteenth-century detractors \u2013 surely a long way from evolution's leading edge.  But just as he is finishing up with those old holdouts, and the reader might suppose he's ready to start moving at least into the mid-twentieth century, Thomas shifts \u2013 not forward, but backward, in time.  He begins discussing how Darwin's views might be analogized to those of certain philosophers and poets of the ancient world.  And so, in a book which proposes to tell us that modern biological science has it all wrong, we are treated to a good deal of discussion of Lucretius.  It is fair to say that this approach is a bit wide of the mark.  Are modern biological hypotheses supported by good data and inferences?  That's a realm to which Thomas \u2013 perhaps wisely \u2013 does not dare to go, but it is the only place worth going.  Without that, why even try to address such a topic?<br /><br />When he's done with Lucretius, he skitters over to the topic of abiogenesis.  Never mind, of course, that this is a topic on which Darwin did little more than speculate broadly, and never mind that it has nothing to do with evolutionary theory in the proper sense.  If you've been keeping company with creationists, as Thomas plainly has, it's easy to confuse abiogenesis with evolution.<br /><br />On abiogenesis, however, he once again is in a time warp.  He talks about the Miller-Urey experiment in the 1950s, then barely mentions anything at all about subsequent research, and declares the whole field a failure.  There's not a mention of, for example, the RNA World hypothesis and the intriguing investigations being done on that score.  Once again, it's a shift back in time to something not terribly helpful: the Shelleys (and, alas, not even the Cambrian \"small shellies,\" who were at least a bit closer to the abiogenesis event than we are).  He lets us know how Percy and Mary differed in THEIR approaches to abiogenesis.  It's not Lucretius, fortunately, but it's no more relevant.  Whether one falls upon the thorns of life and bleeds like Percy's Skylark, or whether one engages in a chase across the tundra with one's creator like Mary's monster, these sorts of references are not terribly helpful.<br /><br />So, after purportedly attacking evolutionary theory and instead just repeating nineteenth-century objections and citing Lucretius, and after purportedly attacking abiogenesis and instead just dismissing Miller-Urey and citing the works of both Shelleys, one might think that the disorganized skittering-about would slow down.  Even the small hoofed animal that can't get its footing on a slick sheet of ice eventually tires of its struggle and takes a rest.  But, no; the skittering continues.<br /><br />The next chapter, if we are to judge by its title, is meant to be about \"Intelligent Design\" Creationism (IDC).  Where classic creationism tends to rest upon a slew of different arguments in various areas, ID Creationism instead focuses on a particular classic creationist argument: the contention that certain features of living things must have their origins in purposeful design.  But here, too, Thomas simply cannot focus.  He begins by returning to Darwin's early detractors, makes a rather incoherent argument to the effect that the human capacity for language cannot be the product of evolution, and brushes up lightly against IDC by citing Michael Denton.  He then starts making a variety of strange claims about the fossil record, ranting about \"missing links,\" and expressing astonishment at how wonderful the human brain is.<br /><br />What one certainly does NOT get from this chapter, oddly, is even a brief summary of the contentions or views of the Intelligent Design Creationists.  But along the way Thomas illustrates, in painful detail, just how bad an idea it is to write a book about a subject on which one knows nothing.  His mistakes are numerous and severe.  He regurgitates a classic creationist mischaracterization of Gould and Eldredge's punctuated equilibria, turning them into saltationists.  He rants about \"missing links,\" mostly showing any educated reader that he understands neither the methods nor the results of paleontology.  He makes claims about the lack of hominid fossils, but along the way, though he spends two pages on the Piltdown Man hoax, he neglects to mention any hominid taxa other than the Neanderthals \u2013 that's two pages on Piltdown, not one mention of (for example) Australopithecines.  He misrepresents the suddenness of the Cambrian explosion.  All of this mindless repetition of creationist talking points could have been avoided, had Thomas decided to consult with actual biologists and learn basic facts about these subjects.<br /><br />Every IDC book has its star howler, and this book is no exception.  He declares: \"In the last half century there has emerged a non-evolutionary mode of biological classification called cladism.\"  Now, that's a whopper of a misunderstanding; the entire POINT of cladistics is that it is a purely evolutionary mode of biological classification.  Its departure from traditional Linnaean classification is just that: for example, where the Linnaean system does not nest tetrapods within fish (from whom all tetrapods descended), cladistics does.  Cladistics aims to identify the evolutionary branching relationships among taxa \u2013 that is its raison d'etre.  His confusion seems to stem from his having read creationist authors who mix this up: because cladists are reluctant to assign ancestor/descendant relationships between fossil species, or between fossil and living species, he thinks they are somehow turning away from evolutionary interpretations, but this is exactly the opposite of the truth.  How can a man purport to be able to write something worthwhile about evolutionary biology and be so fundamentally ignorant of the most basic ideas?<br /><br />Now, the book comes to us from the Discovery Institute, which is the principal promoter of ID Creationism.  Given that, one might suppose it would have contained at least a decent summary of the claims of ID Creationism.  But it really does not.  If I were an IDC proponent, I could not recommend it to anyone \u2013 a person who wanted to understand ID Creationist claims would do better to read such things as the books of Michael Behe or Stephen Meyer, which, though horrid in their own ways, do at least make the nature of these claims clear.<br /><br />Next, in his efforts to critique biology, Thomas leaves the subject of biology entirely and wanders into questions about why our planet is such a lovely place for living things.  That's sure gotta mean somethin', don't it?  What this has to do with biology is anyone's guess, but at least he leaves Lucretius out of it.<br /><br />And then, does it begin to get better?  It does not.  The skittering-about becomes more disorganized and frantic as he waxes philosophical, unmooring himself entirely from any actual subject matter.  He flails his way through a variety of philosophical notions, ungrounded in any understanding of what the biological data actually show us about living things.  If anyone needs a demonstration of Fred Hoyle's proposal that a tornado in a junkyard can assemble nothing useful, he will find it here.<br /><br />At the end, what is there in this book?  There is no real attempt to actually criticize current-day evolutionary theory, nor is there a clear and cogent statement of what the contentions of Intelligent Design Creationism are.  The whole experience, as Thomas dances randomly through the epochs, from Lucretius to Shelley and back again, yet never quite getting around to the present day, is rather like watching Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse-Five trying to write a history of ideas based upon his own experienced sequence of things.<br /><br />The puzzle is this: the Discovery Institute's publications have deteriorated in quality over the years, but this is so poor in every way \u2013 including even in its inability to cogently state the basics of what ID Creationism is about \u2013 that it's hard to understand why the DI thought it ought to be published at all.  No IDC proponent could really recommend this book to anyone who wanted to understand IDC.  What is it good for?<br /><br />At bottom it really looks like there is one, and only one, reason for the publication of this book: the author's self-identification as an \"agnostic,\" paraded in the book's subtitle.  The DI is aware that its commitment to fundamentalist Christian apologetics has become increasingly obvious (see, e.g., Stephen Meyer's The Return of the God Hypothesis and the DI's hilariously poor contributions to the volume titled Theistic Evolution), and it would like to go on insisting that this isn't what ID Creationism (which they usually shorten to \"ID\") is really about.  But to erase the stain of fundamentalism, the DI is going to have to do more than to show that it has an agnostic friend.", "images": [], "asin": "1637120036", "parent_asin": "1637120036", "user_id": "AETU5BYO4FFO5QUPZ64S546VTYWA", "timestamp": 1628105102571, "helpful_vote": 75, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Refreshing Tonic for the Gospel-Centered Pastor", "text": "Preaching the Cross is the compilation of the sermons that were given at the general sessions of the 2006 Together for the Gospel Conference (T4G). Chapters include messages from the faces of T4G, Mark Dever, Al Mohler, CJ Maheney and Ligon Duncan; as well as contributions from John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul and John Piper. Also included is the T4G Affirmations and Denials.<br /><br />This book was enjoyable and edifying for me as I did not attend the conference. I took a message a day and enjoyed interacting with the various preachers. Particular personal favorites included John MacArthur's chapter entitled, Why I Still Preach the Bible after Forty Years of Ministry. This was just littered with pithy MacArthur quotes that serve to simultaneously convict and encourage you.<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><br />  \"Faithfully preaching and teaching the Word must be the very heart of our ministry philosophy. Any other approach replaces the voice of God with human wisdom....The preacher's task is not to be a conduit for human wisdom; he is God's voice to speak to the congregation. No human message comes with the stamp of divine authority--only the Word of God. How dare any preacher substitute another message?\" (p. 143)<br /><br />  \"When I preach, one response that always pleases me most is, `The message was clear.' Clarity is critical and basic. Ambiguity is deadly and produces nothing.\" (p. 148)<br /><br />  \"When I started in ministry, I committed myself to expository preaching, just explaining the Bible, because I knew that there was nothing I could say that was anywhere near as important as what God had to say. The real goal of my ministry has always been to keep my opinions out of it as much as possible--to get the meaning of the passage right and to make it clear to my hearers.\" (p. 148)<br /><br />  \"Show me a church where there is strong Bible teaching over an enduring period of time, and I will show you a congregation that is studying the Word of God on their own skilled in the science of interpretation that has been modeled for them by their pastor. But show me a church where the Word of God is not taught in the pulpit, and I'll show you a place where biblical illiteracy, doctrinal confusion, and spiritual apathy at the personal level is rampant. The people will not rise to a level that is higher than their teacher. They will follow the example of their leaders. So, if we love God's Word, our people will too. If we don't they won't either.\" (p. 157)<br /><br />And there is more where that came from; this chapter is a great encouragement to pastors. It makes you want to study, practice and teach.<br /><br />R.C. Sproul also provides a helpful explanation of the important distinctions between the Roman Catholic doctrine of justification and the Protestant doctrine and in so doing shows why it is so important to understand and proclaim the biblical distinctives.<br /><br />Al Mohler's chapter entitled Preaching with the Culture in View was also quite helpful. Mohler demonstrates careful and thoughtful biblical fidelity by placing a priority on exposition that is not consumed with culture but rather the gospel, with a view towards sinners being rescued from sin.<br /><br />I also found Mark Dever's chapter A Real Minister very refreshing. Dever mixes exhortation throughout to stir our hearts to faithful, gospel-centered ministry.<br /><br />This is just a refreshing book for those who love the gospel, particularly those who are in ministry. I would recommend it for pastors and seminary students, but not to the exclusion of every Christian who enjoys ministry (this should pretty much be everyone). I am regularly looking for books to go through with other guys in an early morning coffee house setting, I think this would be such a book.", "images": [], "asin": "1581348282", "parent_asin": "1581348282", "user_id": "AFI7YWKZVQZ37IAHL6BL4NM3JM6A", "timestamp": 1189847991000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Well worth your time", "text": "This little book is right up there on the New York Times best-seller list. A short read (one hour at most) on how to deal with change in your life.<br />Four mice named Sniff Scurry, Hem and Haw live in a Maze and look for cheese to nourish them to stay happy. The Maze is a metaphorical place  where you look for what you want in life. The mice, it turns out, act like  people and the cheese is a metaphor for whatever it is you want out of  life.<br />In this charming story, the mice are faced with unexpected change  because their cheese disappears. Some of the characters are able to deal  successfully with this change and some are not. One of them (the successful  one) writes about what he learns from this disaster on the walls of the  Maze and thereby hangs the gist of this short, sweet tale. Among the  &quot;writings on the wall&quot; are:<br />&quot;If you do not change. you can  become extinct.&quot; &quot;What would you do if you weren't afraid?&quot;  &quot;The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner  you  find new cheese.&quot;  &quot;Old beliefs do  not lead you to new cheese.&quot; &quot;Noticing small changes early helps  you adapt to bigger changes that arc to come.&quot;<br />Well worth your time.

I had fun reading it just as much as the rest of the story. This was easy to get caught up in and swept away by the mysery, following the dreadfuls and cathing glimpses into actual Victorian life. I think the bits of history worked into the book helped bring the story to life and feel authentic. As well, as the dialogue and slang used.

The power lies in the fact that Sam is unsentimental, not much mush, even though the actual events and stories are emotionally highly charged.

Each of the 3 books are great on their own and even better when combined in this tome.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0486260054 Monster Mazes (Dover Children's Activity Books)]]<br />[[ASIN:0486270491 Pirate Treasure Mazes (Dover Children's Activity Books)]]<br />[[ASIN:0486422275 Wizards and Dragons Mazes (Dover Children's Activity Books)]]<br /><br />This collection has a range of difficulty. The mazes from the Pirate and Wizard books are your standard style mazes, with most being moderate difficulty. The tricky mazes come in the Monster Mazes book, but frankly that is the part of this collection that shines. The Monster Maze book boasts 4 increasingly difficult levels that add in elements beyond your standard mazes, as well as a bit of a story about your travels through the mystic caverns.<br /><br />Monster Mazes Level breakdown (also see the full description of the product via the link above)<br />Level 1 : standard mazes (enter, exit, avoid running into the monsters or the presented hazards)<br />Level 2: mazes with passages (enter the skull passage, exit the other skull passage) this makes it trickier to visually advance through the maze as you go.<br />Level 3: Select an item at the beginning of the maze that can bypass one obstacle. This forces you to work through the mazes several times until you find the correct item combined with the correct path through the maze.<br />Level 4: This is where things get interesting. Each maze has monsters that require one or two arrows to be collected prior to being able to bypass the creatures. Many of these mazes culminate with a final creature that requires even more arrows. This forces the maze-goer to be extra careful to take the appropriate path, not miss any arrows, not waste arrows on creatures you can just go around, and collect enough to defeat the final bosses.<br /><br />Age recommendations: (These recommendations are generous knowing kids vary wildly in how they think and problem solve. I used my own kids as a touch point, as well as my own experience with the Monster Maze book back in 1989)<br />AGE: 5-6 can manage most of the standard mazes, but they will be tough. The younger they are in this range the trickier it will be.<br />AGE: 7-8 can manage the standard mazes and Level 2 of the Monster Maze book. Level 3 will be tough. Some of Level 4 mazes will stump them.<br />AGE: 9+ The final levels of the Monster maze book are challenging but achievable.<br />NOTE: As with most maze books, the solutions are all in the back of the book.<br /><br />Art and designs: The art and design are interesting and well-drawn. Knowing the 3 books that this collection is composed from should help set expectations for the types of art to be found. Monster Mazes is composed of mythical creatures, pulling heavily from Greek mythology (hydras, cerberus, medusa, etc.). The Pirate treasure book is also what you would expect with pirates, skeletons, ships and treasure. The wizards and dragons maze book is also very much what it describes.<br /><br />TL;DR;<br />3 maze books in one. Challenging mazes with mythic and pirate themes.

Okay, where to start here. I know how to use both a MAC and PC. I prefer the PC due to the different apparatuses I use in conjunction with them which are generally google based apps and devices. However, this is Apple and using a MAC (which is a very good computer) can be confusing to a PC user trying to convert.

I found the images rich and colorful. They were accurate to today's MAC's and it is easy to follow. The chapters headings/topics make it easy to navigate for anyone who needs help using basic programs.<br />  Now the rough part which keeps me from giving this a five star is at the beginning of the book, it is instructing Seniors who for some (probably only know how to open the MAC book) on how to fill out on-screen instructions, Wi-Fi connection, safari web browser, settings change, and more. Look, I know this sounds petty, but I've been helping my own mother  (76) navigate these basic things and unless she gets a picture with instructions on the picture showing her exactly what I'm talking about, you might as well be trying to teach them Latin. They simply cannot make connections to names. Therefore it is essential to illustrate all items introduced, regardless of how MAC's order of operations come up with a new set up on the computer.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "OK history, but something missing", "text": "I have read a number of books on WW2 and American Civil War, both of which are incredibly interesting to me to see the motivation behind starting such carnage. WW1 never had much appeal until I figured out that WW2 was just a continuance of WW1 and may never had happened if Germany and Japan had gotten hammered as badly as France and Belgium had in WW1. After reading Barbara Tuchman's excellent `Guns of August', she made the start of WW1 fairly clear and described the atrocities committed by the German army on Belgian citizens. She made the first month of the war fascinating. However, a lot of her reviewers claimed that this book (S L A Marshal's) was a better and fairer depiction of the war.<br /><br />This book is a great history book, with lots of maps and pictures of the time, it describes in great detail the western front, eastern front, Italian front, Austrian and other European and Middle East battles. It also has much better explanation of how the war started by the assassination carried out by Serbian nationalists, and then tells how perfidy got Austria to attack Serbia which brought in Russia and Germany, but it glosses over or ignores personal idiosyncrasies of European leaders that had a huge bearing on initializing the conflict. Why did Germany immediately attack France instead of Russia (Russia was attacking Germany's ally Austria)? What were the German atrocities in Belgium that caused much of the world to be against them (and were repeated in WW2 in Belgium and other countries)? You have to read `The Guns Of August' to find out.<br /><br />In short, for a fairly concise, interesting, and very readable history of WW1 with nice maps and pictures of the era, this book is very good. But, for me, `The Guns of August' is a much more compelling read (at least for the beginning month, which is the only interesting part of the war for me).", "images": [], "asin": "B005OI0TNG", "parent_asin": "B005OI0TNG", "user_id": "AENPPLK43QOHB3H65NFS6Y67RCJA", "timestamp": 1369158728000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

When a range war breaks out tht takes the life of his best friend, he is torn between his duty to his friend, his need to keep his past a secret, and his fear that his wife will reject him if he straps on a gun.  And when it becomes clear to him that the killer is a professional gunman that only he has the skills to defeat, the conflict intensifies.<br /><br />Add to that an element of mystery.... was the killer hired by the logical suspect, or are there more dimensions than appeat?<br /><br />Clinton is a good writer and a master plotter.<br /><br />If you like Westerns, this is well worth your time.", "images": [], "asin": "0893404128", "parent_asin": "0893404128", "user_id": "AHFIVCZIJDJNHJLEBEMADYJEHJXA", "timestamp": 1180205779000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic adventure", "text": "This book was quite entertaining, it had me hooked to the end. It\u2019s true to Rick Riordan's fast-paced style, but is also unique from his other books. The book doesn\u2019t have any slow points in it and it\u2019s obvious Riordan researched his Nordic mythology.<br />The story\u2019s main character, Magnus Chase, starts as a 16 year old homeless kid living on the streets of Boston. He has two good friends and some family connections he is no longer associating with anymore, but otherwise he\u2019s alone. However, on his 16th birthday, his Uncle takes him to a river, and it changes his life forever. He ends up summoning the Sword of Summer from the river's depths, one of the most powerful weapons in Nordic mythology. He is then attacked by a fire giant, who wants the sward. Why? You have to read it to find out.<br />It is difficult to say much more about the story without spoiling it, but Magnus must go on a quest to save the nine worlds from burning in fire. Along the way he faces both unique physical and mental challenges. He meets new people, including humans, gods, and monsters alike. It was 400 pages of fun, and I\u2019m excited for the next book in the series.<br />Personally, I grew rather attached to several of the characters and was engrossed by the daring tasks Magnus and his company had to accomplish. As usual in Rick Riordan\u2019s books, there was a good touch of humor and fast-paced writing style that keep today's society entertained and keeps the book from ever getting too boring.

She lifted it nearly word-for-word from p. 167 of El Cocinero Mexicano (1831), Tomo I, or p. 418 of Diccionario de Cocina o El Nuevo Cocinero Mexicano (1845).  Both books were published in M\u00e9xico by a Mexican for a Mexican audience.  Their huevos hipocr\u00edtas isn\u2019t a typical anglo dish:<br /><br />After cutting ham in thin slices, fry them in butter.  When they\u2019re done, arrange on a plate and pour the butter in which they were fried on them.  Break the eggs and put them on top of the ham, sprinkle with fine salt, pepper and grated nutmeg.  Cook at medium heat until they set.  (my translation)<br /><br />I don\u2019t believe that unitedstatesians prepare ham and eggs this way.  We typically fry ham and eggs separately and serve them side by side.  We don\u2019t cook eggs on top of ham or season fried eggs with nutmeg.<br /><br />I have the original.  On  p. vi Pinedo remarks negatively about English cooks.<br /><br />\u201cThere\u2019s not a single good English cook and their dishes and way of seasoning them is the most insipid and flavorless that can be hoped for.\u201d  (my translation)<br /><br />This is a typical comment on nineteenth century English cooking.  I found no reference in the book to the United States or to US cooking.<br /><br />About Pinedo\u2019s recipes.  Many were lifted, often mangled in the process, from older Mexican cookbooks published in M\u00e9xico.  Her principal sources seem to have been Diccionario de Cocina o El Nuevo Cocinero Mexicano (1845) and Novisimo arte de cocina (1831), both with many later editions.<br /><br />M. E.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "4.5 Stars Review!", "text": "The Most Expensive Night of Her Life by Amy Andrews: Blake Walker knows how to do a lot of things. He's great at keeping a schedule, he's a perfectionist when it comes to woodworking, and he has a bit of experience with flying bullets. Ava Kelly, supermodel and diva wasn't something he'd planned to deal with when his renovation job was over. Blake admitted, he couldn't keep his eyes off her, and she seemed to love the work he and his crew had done to her house. But with a month-long vacation coming the day after this job was done, he'd be glad to see the back of her.<br /><br />Ava wasn't used to people who weren't intimidated by her. Not that she liked that kind of attention, but there was just something about Blake - her very handsome contractor - that made her want to bait him at every turn. She could see that her over the top complaints got to him, but he just wouldn't let his irritation show. It was infuriating. Especially when she not only admired his handiwork, but the delicious package he came in.<br /><br />Neither of them expected his hidden talent to come in handy on the last day of the job. Ava is just about to bid goodbye to Blake when shots fire and he tackles her to keep her safe. Totally swoon-worthy. Okay, the swooning may have been partly due to the knot on her skull when she hit the pavement, but that's not important. What is however, is taking some time off under the radar so the police can find out who's after her. Her agent wants to book her in to her regular hotel, but something tells her she'll be safe with Blake - just for one night.<br /><br />Blake is shocked when she asks him to meet her at the hospital. After all, she's not hurt too badly - and his servitude to her is at an end. He can't help it if she's got some weirdo trying to gun her down. He did what he always does. Reacted like a soldier. He didn't go above and beyond - he just helped another person when the chips were down. When she asks to stay with him for a night until she can figure out what to do, his answer is clear. A firm NO. But she knows his weakness. His sister runs a charity for wounded soldiers that needs an infusion of cash to continue operating, and she's willing to donate it. Blake can't be selfish and say no to help for his sister - after failing her when she needed him most.<br /><br />When 'one night' turns into 'take me along on your boating vacation' - Blake's had enough. There's no way he can stay cooped up in his one-bedroom houseboat for a week or more. But Ava manages to pull another trump card. Not only will she donate the million pounds, she'll become her sister's high-profile benefactor. Against every one of his better judgments, he feels like he has to say yes.<br /><br />Both Blake and Ava have issues with trust, but can they trust each other enough to give in to their attraction and keep it casual? I guessed no, and I was right. :-)<br /><br />I loved this book. Really, truly, loved it. That's saying something, because after reading the first few pages, I was ready to hate Ava. Swanning about her property making demands of the 'servants' (that's never said btw, just the feeling I got). But when the perspective changes from Blake to Ava - her attitude is explained immediately.<br /><br />Both of the main characters have perception issues - some dealing with their bodies, and some dealing with how other people see them through their actions. Ava was more comfortable with her problems, but she'd been dealing with them her entire life. Blake's were more recent, and much more serious. I was touched by how Ava reacted to each new thing she learned about Blake - and I'm ashamed to say I might not have handled things as tactfully as she did.<br /><br />Amazing story, great characters, really intense situations, and super hot love scenes. Give Ava a few pages and I think you'll like her. Blake...

Perhaps one good example is this quote from \"Now\": \u201cwe know from relativity that since waves carry energy, they also carry mass, and gravity does indeed pull on them.\u201d  More carefully written books will point out that the mass component of E=mc\u00b2 goes to zero for electromagnetic waves and that the other part of the equation involving momentum dominates.  But, that\u2019s not even discussed until much later and then not very well, leaving the reader to ponder: if light has mass, wouldn\u2019t it be infinite?  There seems to be a lot of this sort of sloppiness in the book spread amongst some insightful gems in the first half, but, particularly towards the end, he asserts with authority things which just should not be asserted as true in a popular science book which explains a new theory, one of them being: \u201cI do know I have a soul.\u201d  You\u2019ll see that bit of strangeness scattered here and there in the book and perhaps wonder what these assertions have to do with the subject of defining \u201cNow\u201d and presenting his new theory of time.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Compelling!  (A bit too compelling, in fact.)", "text": "A (rather too) fast-moving and enthralling narrative, as the horse transports man through a flawless dressage by millennial leaps and bounds of history.  The text is in fact as forceful (by dint of its outstanding dearth of equivocation) as an 8,000-horsepower locomotive, which cannot be derailed, or even sidetracked by the cautionary semaphores of circumspect modern historians.  The author took the bit between her teeth (so to speak) and began with a nuclear thesis that the horse successively revolutionized human transport and then warfare, and was the vehicle that took Indo-European languages and culture from an Urheimat at the western borders of the Eurasian steppe to its farther adventitious and evolutionary manifestations in the four directions of the compass, reviving the centum-satem dichotomy in the process.  The most-critical previous review rightly calls attention to the author's facile (and mostly tacit) ironing-out of wrinkles and patching-over of holes in the very thin and worn fabric of ancient history and prehistory in this largely unobstructed narrative; and the reviewer is correct in observing that selected parenthetical literature citations do not substitute for substantive argumentation. Kelekna essentially has cherry-picked published opinions, however distant from the scholarly center of gravity they might be, and deployed them as if they were proofs of what she wrote -- which they are not; I would be surprised, in fact, if the very authors she cites would not disagree with a variety of points in Kelekna's rather implausibly tight-knit synthesis.  Nevertheless, her fundamental tenets relating to the consequences of horse domestication and use of the horse in transport and warfare are cogently argued, and the ritual significance of the horse in various apparently related ancient cosmologies and religions seems incontrovertible.  So, taking the mean of 2 stars for liberties freely taken with historicity and 4 stars for stimulation and interest, I award 3 stars.  If the axe had not been ground quite so feverishly and myopically, this might have been a very nice piece of scholarship -- but then, of course, we would have something much more voluminous, and less certain, with numerous tangents, and consequently soporific for the general reader.

From my point of view, this is a rather technical book that attempts to cover the history of astrophysics, going back to the 1600's (when scientists thought that our Milky Way galaxy comprised the entire &#34;universe&#34;).<br /><br />I have a solid background in science, going back to my time as an undergraduate, and extending to my graduate school experiences and my master's degree.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "fast-paced, full of depth, personality, and even some humor", "text": "As the fifth book in Elly Griffiths' series about forensic archeologist Ruth Galloway, _A Dying Fall_ differs in some ways from the previous four books.  This one takes place largely in the north of England, and for various reasons, the main characters all end up being there at the same time--Ruth and her daughter Kate, Cathbad, DCI Nelson, and his wife Michelle. As has been the case in the earlier books, Griffiths' description is highly atmospheric; one is immediately immersed in a setting that is vivid and unique.  This one was perhaps a little less complicated in its plot than some of the others in the series, but it still offers great pleasure, and it also means that it's less important to have read the previous books in the series.  There is still a bit of humor in the writing too, which is very enjoyable.<br /><br />There are of course some stylistic similarities in Griffiths' mysteries too, such as the writing in present tense.  This feature has bothered some readers, but I feel that it conveys a feeling of experiencing events as they happen.  The story is narrated too, so that the reader knows more than any of the characters, and that too is quite special.  There is plenty of suspense, as well as a chilling scene in the latter part of the book, both of which add significantly to the pacing and keep one's interest nicely.  The young Kate is a real charmer, and Cathbad is less shadowy and mysterious than he has been in previous books.  Like some other reviewers, I would say this book is the best of the series so far, but it's a tough choice.  They're all first-rate mysteries, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next one.", "images": [], "asin": "0547798164", "parent_asin": "0547798164", "user_id": "AFH7WM5TULLDJQMUD6NJFSVVUBAQ", "timestamp": 1363210068000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disjointed...", "text": "Based on all the rave reviews that this book received, I should have loved it.  Instead, I had to force myself to complete this pretentious, plodding bore, since I truly hate to give up on any book<br /><br />I found the characters to not be at all well defined.  Just when I though I might get some deeper insight into one of them, the author moved on to another character.  The book starts out with e-mails from Jerome to Howard.  Very interesting.  However, Jerome essentially disappears from the rest of the book.  Claire, Carl, and Levi - I was waiting to find out a great deal more about these characters, but instead I had to read the boring and incredibly predictable scene in which Victoria and Howard have sex (honestly, who was surprised by this?)  What is the hot, sexy college student Victoria's motivation for wanting to have sex with the 50ish year old Howard?  This is never explained.  And in the end, when Howard spurns her further advancements, do we find out anything more about her?  No.  We do however find out that Howard simply likes her.  Why?  What's to like?<br /><br />I also found the story to be incredibly disjointed.  Various story lines were started and then dropped.  Howard's visit with his father, the developing friendship between Kiki and Carlene, The painting that Carlene \"willed\" to Kiki, Jerome's Christianity and many others.  None of these things were explored to their fullest.<br /><br />The author must have been paid by the word.  There are numerous page long plus paragraphs that say absolutely nothing.  This book needed a better editor since it could have been shortened by about 100 pages and we wouldn't have missed a thing.<br /><br />Another reviewer recommended Richard Russo's STRAIGHT MAN and I couldn't agree more.  It is a wonderful book about academia.  Better characters, better story.  Give that one a try instead.", "images": [], "asin": "0143037749", "parent_asin": "0143037749", "user_id": "AFKVGSVNLQCDZRS5EYH5MMJDI6FA", "timestamp": 1168870359000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": false}

Conscientious to a fault, she always wants to help her patients, no matter what, no matter how she\u2019s feeling herself. We definitely see these patients up close in their intense, truthful, and insightful therapy sessions: an unfaithful husband, a couple with an abusive husband, an inappropriate flirt, a man entering a complicated relationship, and a disturbed woman who keeps talking to her \u201cangel.\u201d<br /><br />But Grace has her own issues. She\u2019s been a friend to and romantically interested in a married man for years, who has just now returned\u2013\u2013still married. Then, after she notices a distant person as a stalking presence, a button is stolen from her favorite office chair, and a blank note is shoved under her door, tensions heat up. She contacts a very attractive detective from years before who comes to help and protect her, yet ends up adding more complication in her life. For, as their mutual attraction grows, it all adds to her already swirling mind.<br /><br />Then, when someone nearby is murdered, the overall fear ratchets up exponentially. No longer is each patient possibly a stalker; now he/she could be a murderer. For me, throughout, those pages couldn\u2019t turn fast enough. And how about that ending! What is it, you may ask? You\u2019ll just have to read the book to find out.  All I can say is, having been exposed to this author\u2019s work before, I knew I would be in for an intriguing ride, and indeed, I was.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enjoyed the audiobook version", "text": "I liked this book more than I thought I would. I listened to the audiobook version read by the author. I feel like I connected more to what the author was trying to convey while listening. I especially enjoyed the chapter where she talks about her relationship with her mom.<br /><br />I have been reading this author's blog for many years, and there was one thing that I felt like she glossed over in her book. The author speaks of a relationship with a man where she was shamed for the amount of food she was eating. She touches on her inability to speak up and talk about why she needed to eat what she was eating and when (she was training for a marathon). She states that she hadn't thought about what she was eating in over 20 years and that the actions of the person she was in a relationship with at the time put her back in a place where she experienced negative thoughts about her body and eating habits. As a reader of her blog for many years, I have noticed that one of the main themes of this author's writing is what she is eating/not eating and what exercise regimen she is following FAITHFULLY.  She is ALWAYS doing SOMETHING. Valedictorian style. She's not eating sugar, she's doing a juice fast, she's doing Paleo, she's eating \"clean\", she's vegan. She's doing spin classes, she's running marathons, she's running stairs, she's lifting weights...and ALL of these eating habits/exercise regimens have CHANGED HER LIFE. Her body image issues are discussed somewhat in the book, but to say that she only had one episode of disordered thinking/eating in 20 years is a gross understatement.<br /><br />Overall am glad that I listened to this book. I am happy that the treatment helped the author come out of her deep depression and that she is able to share hope with others.

This fact hits close to home when he is attacked at home by three men. Upon further investigation, it is discovered that his address had been made public after a man named Verlyn Merritt releases sensitive NYPD documents to Wikileaks. Merritt is taken into custody but cleared of involvement in the attack on Fisk. Shortly there after, a series of random shootings start to occur. The shooter issues an ultimatum: one citizen will be shot each day until Merritt is released. The atmosphere of the city becomes one of terror, as citizens are too scared to leave their homes. As the death count rises, time is running out for the NYPD to discover who is behind these attacks and how to stop them.<br /><br />The Ultimatum by Dick Wolf, is the third entry in the new series by the well-known creator of Law and Order. At the center of the series is veteran NYPD Intelligence detective Jeremy Fisk. Just like his notable TV series, The Ultimatum draws its inspiration from real-life events and the result is a captivating novel that seems all too possible. The depth of the characters and pace of the story demonstrate Wolf\u2019s skill as a writer. The plot does not get bogged down in technical details but has enough to keep the reader motivated to read further.

At times it crosses the line into sentimentality, but romantics will take heart and a handful of tissues. Both the movie and the book condensed and misrepresented the real history of the real Elephant Man for dramatic effect. They also got his name wrong; it was Joseph and not John, but this is a common mistake attributed to his doctor's memoir. However, what Christine Sparks captures is the humanity of a man who was barely accepted as human, who in turn inspired others to view their own lives and the things we easily take for granted through his eyes. The earnestness of Merrick and his pure joy at the simple pleasures in life, like hearing the happy laughter of the nurses on the ward, remind the reader of how easy it to be distracted from enjoying life.", "images": [], "asin": "0345345134", "parent_asin": "0345345134", "user_id": "AE23YY4UZVDLLZDMIHVJ77SF3OVA", "timestamp": 1323145209000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I wish I could be ordinary genius", "text": "One potential problem with group biographies, even with a group of two individuals, is that the members of the group may not have much to do with eachother.  In this case, Max Delbruck and George Gamow were acquaintances and then friends from their 20s, so this problem does not arise.  Delbruck, of German origin, and Gamow, of Russian origin, were both physicists who shifted their studies from pure physics to what we would call molecular biology for Delbruck and mostly astrophysics and cosmology for Gamow. Delbruck was born in Berlin in 1906 (he died in 1980) and Gaow in Odessa in 1904 (he died in 1968) When they started their careers as physicists, they were both focused on quantum mechanics, the hot topic in physics in the 1920s.  They met at the German university at Gottingen in 1928, and lat Institute for Theoretical Physics run by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr.  Delbruck seems to have had difficulty in finding a niche in physics and while working as a phyicist at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin in the 1930s became interested in molecular biology.  He moved to the United States in the late 1930s and realized while at the California Institute of Technology that bateriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, would be a good model system for determining what the physical nature of the gene was. Starting in the 1940s Delbruck ran an influential short course on the uses of bacteriophages in genetic research at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island. Delbruck's work with Salvador Luria using bacteriophages was influential in genetics research. Gamov escaped from the Soviet Union in the early 1930s and took a position at George Washington University in Washington D. C.  He organized a series of influential conferences which got him interested in the physics of stars and cosmology.  With his collaborators Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, Gamov developed an early version of the Big Bang model of the origin of the universe in the 1940s. Unfortunately, this work did not have the impact one might have hoped, and in particular no empirical work was done on the subject for about 15 years, by which time their papers appear to have been forgetten. Gamow also wrote a number of well-recieved popular science books.<br /><br />I first posted this review at goodreads.com", "images": [], "asin": "0670022764", "parent_asin": "0670022764", "user_id": "AGLMLTYLZSBYWDC6HG2NXRH4MFRA", "timestamp": 1324225737000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

While I could have read this story cover to cover in just one day, my kids wouldn't allow me the freedom to do so. For those who don't know Biltmore, the story paints the beautiful home and some of its history quite well. For those who have visited Biltmore (even multiple times, like myself), the story brings more magic to the readers' memories of their own experiences at the estate. As a teacher, I can envision a whole literature unit based on the book, a study of the history and geography of the region, and of course class field trips. I would recommend and describe it to mature elementary students and adults as a heroine-based, Harry Potter-type story set in early America. I look forward to sharing &#34;Serafina and the Black Cloak&#34; with my young daughters as soon as they're ready to listen to a chapter book and taking them to visit the estate someday.

Webrid -- a Yeril -- is a carter. He delivers stuff throughout the planetary system. Or used to, before (in the previous book I didn't read) he saved the world. That was when he got very rich and didn't have to cart anymore.<br /><br />Webrid doesn't live like a rich guy. He lives like a drunken slob because that's what he is. And that's exactly what he wants to be. He just happens to be a multi-millionaire drunken slob.<br /><br />When his world is rocked by massive earthquakes that destroy his home and threaten to wipe out his city, planet and the entire Raralt Circle of planets, he isn't surprised the government calls on him to deliver a gigantic blue diamond to the machine that holds the planets in orbit. This is no ordinary delivery. The fate of every living creature on all the planets in the Circle depends on it and Webrid. Or, more to the point, Webrid and his pals.<br /><br />Webrid owns the cart and has the brawn and determination to get the job done. He pals Stravin and Zatell have the brains to figure out how. Zatell also has a rocket ship, an important component. And Stravin has a few other critical items they're going to need to pull off this \"saving the world\" thing.<br /><br />Webrid is not quite a hero, even a reluctant one. He's a good carter. If he has a delivery to make, he will make it or die trying, though he is not averse to  some hot babes and a sea of booze too. He figures the booze and hot babes are the point. Yerils are big and strong, but the species is firmly committed to cowardice and self-interest. Odd how Webrid keeps saving the day, even though he doesn't know what or why he's doing what he's doing. Usually.<br /><br />It took me a while to realize how funny this book is. Talk about over-thinking a story, I was trying to figure out what these characters might actually look like until I realized it didn't matter. My job was to read and enjoy it. After that, I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />I'm glad I stuck with the book. It got funnier and funnier as it went along until I found myself laughing out loud at the delicious silliness of the characters and story.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book if you (a) have a taste for bizarre science fiction and (b) don't mind species with incomprehensible body designs. If you just roll with it, you'll enjoy clever dialogue, weird inventions and outlandish technology. Blue Diamond Delivery could be a great animated feature film. It's pure fun and reminds me of some of the books I read to my son when he was young, but aimed at adults. Childish adults. Like me.<br /><br />Enjoy. You can get it in paperback and I'm guessing on Kindle too since the review copy is Kindle format. You can order the paperback from Amazon.com and probably elsewhere too.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nRQrpXK+L._SL256_.png", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nRQrpXK+L._SL800_.png", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nRQrpXK+L._SL1600_.png", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "1936460483", "parent_asin": "1936460483", "user_id": "AHC3RBIJXYZYYZARERK5TOKF4TPQ", "timestamp": 1372011821000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

Ink would clog up the little lines used to symbolize dark squares. And if the little metal block represented a black piece on a dark square, it would sometimes muddy up all the way into a black blotch.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The First Non-Sports Book I Loved", "text": "A few years ago, for reasons I couldn't remember if my life depended on it, I bought a book that didn't have to do with sports.  It was Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising.  At the time I didn't have any knowledge  whatsoever of military happenings in the world.  I remembered the Gulf War  as a nuissance that the news had aired for a month instead of sports  (gasp!).  Until RSR, I hadn't read a book that was longer than 300 pages.  Sound familiar?  I'm writing this review for those of you who are like I  was.<br />The first time I read Red Storm Rising, it took me about a week.  I  don't remember why (I have a terrible memory, don't I?), but I loved it,  even though I didn't understand most of the jargon and tactics.  I then  embarked on a week of net-surfing to learn everything I could about the  weapon systems Clancy described.  I even borrowed a book from the library  about the Cold War, and this is at age fifteen (my friends thought I was  nuts).  Then I read my new favorite book again, and I actually understood a  lot of the air, land, and sea combat sequences.<br />Anyway, one book doesn't  make an addiction, so the next trip to the bookstore I bought &quot;The  Hunt for Red October&quot;.  Take a look at its reviews and guess how I  reacted to it.  I was officially hooked on techno-thrillers.<br />Today, I  have every book in the Tom Clancy collection (except for the Net Forces and  Powerplays), and I loved every one to one degree or another.  I also have  all or nearly all of Larry Bond's (who was a co-writer with Clancy on Red  Storm Rising) and Stephen Coonts' books.  These writers, along with Clancy,  do their homework when writing their books.  I haven't detected a single  error in their military jargonizing (I may be wrong), and they spend a lot  of time (couple hundred pages) developing the story, instead of just  saying, &quot;stuff happened, now let's get to the action!&quot;.  There  are also a bunch of new authors who have this skill (ie. - Patrick  Robinson, James Cobb) who you should check out if you like Clancy, Coonts  and Bond.<br />P.S. - If you really liked Red Storm Rising and you want more  Cold War era NATO-USSR war books, be forewarned; there aren't many good  ones.  If you see one called &quot;WWIII&quot; by Ian Slater, don't touch  it with a ten foot pole.  It's a series of books, and he evidently has no  knowledge at all about military hardware and international politics.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"Weren't all of us bridges for each other, one way or another?\"", "text": "I've been a fan of Emma Donoghue's writing from the moment I first encountered her novel Room. I breezed through that book in a day, and I've eagerly awaited each of her works since. The thing I love most about opening a Donoghue novel is that I never quite know what to expect. She seems to be one of the few authors writing today who has no problem bouncing from genre to genre. No matter where her imagination takes her, Donoghue always satisfies with deeply drawn characters, elegant prose, and a keen sense of reality that makes each book a wonder to behold. Based purely upon my enjoyment of her previous works, I happily accepted a copy of her latest novel Akin to review on behalf of her publisher.<br /><br />As he approaches his eightieth birthday, Noah Selvaggio has much to be proud of. Both Noah and his late wife were acclaimed chemists and professors for years. He still resides in the couples West Side apartment in New York. Though the couple never started a family of their own, they took pride in their work and the young minds they were able to influence. In preparation for his milestone birthday, Noah has decided to take a trip to the place of his birth Nice, France. He hasn't visited the city since he fled the war at the young age of four. Armed with a collection of photos that belonged to his mother, he hopes to revisit the town of his youth and piece together the puzzle that is his family history.<br /><br />Just when it seems like Noah's quest to rediscover his family's past is all set, a situation with his current family intervenes. With the passing of his sister, there is no one to look after Noah's great-nephew Michael. Michael's mother is currently incarcerated, and it looks like the only thing standing between Michael and foster care is Noah. But surely Noah can't be responsible for a child. Overcome with a sense of familial duty, Noah agrees to take temporary guardianship of the boy. The odd couple of eleven-year-old and soon to be octogenarian must find common ground as they embark on a globetrotting trip to reconnect with their shared roots.<br /><br />With Akin, Donoghue finds magic in the small moments between adult and child. She perfectly captures the voices of the two drastically different generations and finds humor, emotion, and understanding through the juxtaposition of the two. I was instantly taken by the internal thoughts of Noah. For a man who has prided himself on being one of the most knowledgable people in the room, his struggle to understand the mind of a child is a unique and unfamiliar challenge. Donoghue sprinkles in some mystery surrounding the photos left to Noah by his mother that adds an extra layer of depth to the family history and gives the book just enough momentum to move it beyond just the relationship between the two characters. Superbly written and emotionally satisfying, Akin is another indisputable win from Donoghue.", "images": [], "asin": "B07MS8GCGV", "parent_asin": "B07MS8GCGV", "user_id": "AH25FB5EAAE5OPYNROJMTZ2GFEQQ", "timestamp": 1571095018310, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not enough Gabriel, too much political commentary", "text": "I have read all of Silva's Gabriel Allon books and enjoyed most of them...mainly because of the way Gabriel is written. He's such a painfully tragic figure. Despite his talents as a painter, despite having a loving wife and children, he's deeply haunted. Not only is he burdened by his past, but he seems almost obsessed with the need to kill in the name of the State of Israel.<br /><br />The problem with &#34;The Black Widow&#34; is that Gabriel doesn't kick into action until 7/8th of the way through the book. The rest of the time, he's stuck in a room monitoring his field agents as they fight ISIS terrorists.<br /><br />Not to get too much into politics, but Silva brings out a political sledgehammer in this one. He clearly blames Obama for pulling troops out of Iraq in 2011 and allowing ISIS to emerge. This despite the fact that Bush signed the original agreement to withdraw all troops back in 2008. Obama tried to renegotiate with Iraq to leave a residual force, but the Iraqis did not want us there. They refused to grant US troops immunity from criminal prosecution, so we pulled out as agreed.<br /><br />At the time, 75% of Americans supported full withdrawal of US forces.<br /><br />So it's hard to tell what Silva is driving at. Should the US have left troops in a country that did not want them? Should US troops have remained to be killed by IEDs, snipers and car bombs? Should the US now make up for it by sending ground troops into a sovereign nation (Syria) to fight ISIS? Silva certainly seems to be in favor of it.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon is a wonderful character of fiction. Daniel Silva should give us more of him and less of his own armchair diplomacy.", "images": [], "asin": "0062320238", "parent_asin": "0062320238", "user_id": "AFXP6XLS746WBLNYH435WDIBCMFQ", "timestamp": 1489544831000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Worth the read, too much happening at the end.", "text": "I love these kinds of novels. I\u2019m always up for a plot filled with intrigue, who\u2019s going to backstab who, who\u2019s got the dirty secrets and who\u2019s the horrible but cunning bastage that will expose these secrets and so on\u2026.<br /><br />I had to whip out my dictionary for these latin/Catholic terms that are prevalent throughout this novel. (My knowledge in Catholicism is very rusty.) But you learn something new all the time right? Now I know there\u2019s actually names for each piece of their clothing these men wear.<br /><br />I love how it in the first third of the novel the plotting to be the next pope starts. It\u2019s a reminder that even though these people are spiritual figureheads and we look to them as authority figures, they\u2019re still humans with ambition. But this is the part I loved reading the most. I love the intrigue, I love the plotting. I love how Lomeli is in the middle of this and is trying to make sure everything in the voting process is legitimate.<br /><br />You have a group of characters to keep track of, but there isn\u2019t much to them. They\u2019re broken into cliques to keep track of them easily but the book is centralized on Lomeli and he\u2019s the only one that develops throughout the novel. He\u2019s likable for the most part and does deal with his inner self for the most part. He has his faults as well which makes sense (who doesn\u2019t want to be pope?!) which makes these characters realistic.<br /><br />The plot itself starts off really well. I liked the pace and events during the story. What bothered me was the last third of the novel where everything went chaotic and the author seemed to inject some action to make it more lively. I didn\u2019t think it was necessary and there wasn\u2019t any need for that. What I would prefer is more intrigue and inner plotting amongst the Cardinals. (There was but there was no need to the action sequence which wasn\u2019t even a feature it happened \u201coff screen\u201d.)<br /><br />Another thing which didn\u2019t sit too well was it was one thing after another with the surprises. First it was this guy. Then the other. Oh, can\u2019t forget this guy either. We already elected the pope? No wait here\u2019s another monkey wrench. It was just too much (by the end I was screaming out: \u201cJust give him the papacy and let\u2019s go home. This is getting ridiculous\u201d.) Some parts were spaced out but it just felt too much. However, good on the author to make sure all the loose ends were tied together. Nothing was left unanswered.<br /><br />I liked this book but it would have been better without all the extra bits and pieces here. More intrigue and plotting within. It\u2019s what makes it so much better. Otherwise, it was a short quick read and worth it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "Even though I did not care for the last Julie James title, I was still looking forward to this one.  Unfortunately, Love Irresistibly suffers from a few of the same issues About That Night had.<br /><br />To begin with, there is very little in the way of conflicts or obstacles for the hero and heroine to overcome.  The description of the book says, \"A former football star and one of Chicago's top prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Cade Morgan will do anything to nail a corrupt state senator, which means he needs Brooke Parker's help. As general counsel for a restaurant company, she can get a bug to the senator's table at one of her five-star restaurants so the FBI can eavesdrop on him. All Cade has to do is convince Brooke to cooperate--and he's not afraid to use a little charm, or the power of his office, to do just that.\"<br /><br />This isn't the storyline of the book - it's simply the way the two main characters meet.  The bugging of the table and its outcome are actually over quite early in the story.  From that point on, we're reading  a lot about two work driven people who grant each other booty call status.  Since the situation regarding the bugging of the table, and the subsequent favor Brooke calls in later are over and done with quickly and don't amount to any real meaningful part of the story, it really doesn't matter where these people work - they could have worked at Dunkin Donuts.  There was very little connection in the story between the action and the type of jobs the characters have.  Labeling this book part of a FBI/US Attorney series seemed rather pointless.<br /><br />The rest of the story has the main characters struggling with their personal trust issues.  There was a great deal of inner contemplation and discussions with friends about whether the two main characters should give in to their feelings and allow themselves to love.  Honestly, all that whining and emoting began to make them sound like people on a reality show (I detest reality shows).  When a frank two minute conversation between the main characters can clear up the perceived problems, there simply isn't a lot going on.  I don't want to read about people thinking.  I want the characters to be DOING something.  Julie James' earlier titles (Practice Makes Perfect, Something About You and Just the Sexiest Man Alive) had their flaws, but they were funny and witty and the main character's occupations were actually meaningful to the story.<br /><br />A few final issues...the character Zach does not sound/read like a sixteen year old boy.  The voice just sounded wrong.  Zach simply should have introduced himself as \"Convenient Plot Progression Garrity\".  The constant references to hip and trendy eateries start to grate on the nerves (although I'll give you the dessert cart references - those were funny).  The emphasis and descriptions of the shoes are getting tiresome and if the main female character's best friend calls her \"Babe\" (in any of James' novels) one more time, I may have to punch someone in the throat. The ending was abrupt.  I actually turned the page to see what would happen next, only to discover that was the end of the story.  And finally (I promise), is there any chance of the characters having names that aren't straight off the \"Trendy Androgynous Name List\"?  Payton,Cameron,Rylann,Jordan,Taylor....at least Brooke was a step in the right direction, but then we went off the rails a little with the guy's names - Cade, Ford, Vaughn...

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Popper misunderstands Parmenides completely", "text": "Sir Karl Popper writes: &#34;Parmenides opened my eyes to the poetic beauty of the Earth and the starry heavens, and he taught me to consider them with a new searching look. He adds: It (Parmenides\u2019 approach to understand the world) was, for all I know, the first deductive theory of the world, the first deductive cosmology: One further step led to theoretical physics, ... &#34;<br /><br />What Popper writes about Parmenides and other Pre-Socratics is wishful thinking, far from representing these wise sages who knew the path to get in contact with the reality based on: \u201cWe are in contact with true reality, if we forget all theory\u201d. Popper gives no hint, how this \u2018extraordinary reality behind the familiar one\u2019 is to be perceived. It is the world that Parmenides calls BEING (e\u00f3n). He taught the path to experience it.<br /><br />Poppers misinterpretation of Parmenides results from misconceiving BEING (e\u00f3n), commonly thought to be Being (familiar world), and Non-BEING (m\u00e8 e\u00f3n), commonly thought to be Nonbeing (opposite of Being). This is wrong. Popper has to be excused. Already Parmenides criticized his contemporaries who mixed up BEING with Non-BEING:<br /><br />1. \u2026 they (people) are carried along deaf and blind alike, dazed, beasts without judgement, convinced that \u201eto be (BEING)\u201c and \u201enot to be (Non-BEING)\u201c are the same and not the same (B 6.5-9).<br /><br />The correct interpretation is: Non-BEING is Being, the created world of the familiar senses, and BEING is the eternally creative world that creates it by emanation. This is the original interpretation, which got lost with the disappearance of the unwritten philosoph\u00eda with the closure of the last neo-Platonic schools. It is required to understand the two paths of gaining two kinds of knowledge that Parmenides refers to in his poem On Nature.<br /><br />The first path is the Path (h\u00f3dos) to Truth (al\u00e9theia), which he also calls the path from Non-BEING (m\u00e8 e\u00f3n) to BEING (e\u00f3n). It is based on the first cognition principle, which Parmenides taught, like all other masters of the philosoph\u00eda, to his students: The consciousness and five senses can be expanded by a unique rigorous meditative self-observation that Plato calls in Phaidros (81a) the pleasurable (phaidros) practice of dying (mel\u00e9te than\u00e1tou). It is the source of all knowledge (gn\u00f3sis) that the philosoph\u00eda provides (see my other reviews).<br /><br />The second path is the path of opinion (d\u00f3xa) confined to the familiar senses. It satisfies the second cognition principle: \u201cBeing determines consciousness (German: Das Sein bestimmt das Bewusstsein)\u201d. The familiar sciences (e.g. the natural ones) are dedicated to investigate Being. This corresponds to the path of opinion, because the investigation is based on improvable hypotheses (assumptions, conditions, conjectures like the mathematical axioms) and conclusions that must be believed in. We associate this approach with &#34;rational thinking&#34;.<br /><br />This implies that Being cannot \u2013 contrary to what most of us believe who accept that it to be the one and only or true reality \u2013 be proven to exist. The prevailing opinion is even today that its existence is obvious. But this means little. As Being is the world that has to be believed in, it means that its existence cannot be proven. Parmenides formulates this fundamental observation (B 7.1):<br /><br />2. For never shall this prevail that \u2018things that are not (Being = Non-BEING = m\u00e8 e\u00f3n)\u2019 are (exist).<br /><br />BEING, on the other hand and in juxtaposition to Being, can \u2013 believe it or not - be truly experienced and thus proven with the practice of dying by unconditioned extrasensory self-observation. I am experienced with such a practice in my Tai Chi-school that offers the Tao-path. I view it as the Chinese counterpart of the Path to Truth.<br /><br />It increasingly accesses the truth (alethe\u00eda) by unconditioned recollection (anamn\u00e9sis) that emerges out of itself. It cannot be questioned by the practitioner who increasingly experiences BEING with it in function of his capability to rigorously get into a quiet state of mind. Parmenides characterises BEING:<br /><br />3. BEING (e\u00f3n) is uncreated and indestructible, very unique, without siblings (non-dual), steadfast, not to be completed (Frag. 8).<br /><br />He also calls it the ONE (h\u00e9n) and recommends:<br /><br />4. It is necessary to speak and to think \u2018what is\u2019; for \u2018BEING (\u2018what truly is\u2019) is (exists), but \u2018nothing (Non-BEING = Being)\u2019 is not (B 6.1-2).<br /><br />I extract from this last quote, which is commonly mistranslated by the trivial statement \u201cBeing is and Nonbeing is not\u201d: Practitioners (adepts of the practice of dying) should dedicate themselves not to any abstractions (i.e. conjectures by which Being is conceived). If they would, they could not perceive BEING.<br /><br />I complete my criticism of Sir Karl Popper by stating that all other profound statement of Parmenides on BEING and Non-BEING can be brought in perfect agreement with what I indicate above.<br /><br />Who wants to know more about the Path to Truth (Tao path) or first cognition principle taught by the \u201cgenuine Parmenides\u201d and thus overcome the illusion (blah blah) reported about him, will find more information in The Plato Code.

Surely most people in the world have heard of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 1986. Since then, many accounts as to what \u201cexactly\u201d happened, etc., have surfaced \u2013 some more accurate than others and some completely misleading if not outright false. In this spellbinding book, the author sets the record straight in minute detail \u2013 before the accident, during, after and the lingering aftermath.<br /><br />I found this book hard to put down. The author\u2019s prose is clear, well-researched, lively and immensely captivating. It contains many passages that can make a reader infuriated while other passages, very sad. The suffering endured by the exposed first responders as well as exposed plant workers is pain-stakingly and heart-wrenchingly described. This book should be of interest to anyone interested in true disaster stories as well as those wondering about how not to officially react to nuclear disasters within your borders. Those fascinated by the Soviet mentality still prevalent during the period in which the accident occurred will also find much of interest here.

With Dara and Nick, it runs somewhere in between. They are only eleven months apart with Nick being the elder. Nick also wears the title of perfect older sister to Dara's rebellious little sister. They each feel they have very defined roles in their family. There are a lot of underlying issues both sisters have with each other not the least of which is resentment. Nick resents Dara for having to clean up the messes her rebellions make and Dara resents Nick for always being first and best.<br /><br />The sisters' relationship is not the only one explored but it is kept central to the story. The secondary relationships allow the reader to see how Dara and Nick relate to the people in their lives. So much of the push of the story hinges on the finding the truth of what happened on the night of the accident. Through experiencing memories of before the accident, we see how Dara and Nick's relationship had begun to deteriorate with neither one of them knowing how to fix the ever growing rift between them. I loved how even while you feel the animosity between them, there is still the underlying love they will always have for each other.<br /><br />The plot twist took me by surprise and being surprised took me by surprised. (You know what I mean.) I usually, but not always, figure out what the twist is, or have some clue before the big reveal but not this time. This time when I read the plot twist my reaction ran along the lines of &#34;wait...what?&#34; I had to re-read the section in order to absorb what had happened.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The duality of the southern thing", "text": "I enjoyed this book. I probably wasn't as invested as some people got to be in my love of Scout or of Atticus, so perhaps I didn't have as much to get over as some others had to while reading this book.<br />This book can easily be read as a stand alone book.<br />There has been a lot of talk and concern about which book was written first and/or when etc. Regardless of these questions, this book is well timed. It is relevant right now for many of the same reasons that To Kill a Mockingbird was important for its time.<br />It is very well written and was a joy to read. I found it to be essentially realistic; with some of &#34;the duality of the southern thing&#34;, as the Drive By Truckers intoned in the song, The Three Alabama Icons.<br />This book is about growing up and about how grown up we think we are, even in old age, and how far we have to go. And this holds true for a community/society just as it does for the individual. Most of all this book is is about how difficult it can be to love and how right it is to care throughout the difficult process of loving or learning to love.<br />This is a coming of age book; a mature book intent upon more maturity in, or at, any age. When it comes to state's rights, if we're not still fighting the civil war, we still seem far from reconstruction.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Another winning episode in the Cottage Tales series", "text": "Avid fans are now familiar with Miss Potter's retreats to her properties in the Land Between the Lakes ... and with her propensity for unraveling some of the mysteries that occur there.  Here, it's December 1909, and Beatrix arrives just in time for a substantial snowfall that effectively maroons the Sawrey residents.  She welcomes the fact that she's cut off from London.  But a double tragedy has already taken place:  Hugh Wickstead is dead, and Lady Longford's hay barn has burned down.  Were both incidents accidents?  Where is the Viking treasure that Wickstead supposedly found?  Was he as cursed as the village gossips say he was?  What is Mr. Heelis' relationship with Sarah Barwick? (Or with Miss Potter, for that matter?)  And in a subplot twist that could easily be contemporary:  the bank is about to foreclose on Courier Cottage, the home of the Suttons and their eight children.  Can their hired girl Deidre find a way to get the veterinarian's customers to finally pay their bills?<br /><br />As usual, the tale is told in omniscient style by a chatty off-screen narrator, mimicking the style found in Miss Potter's very own children's books.  And again, as usual, the animals of the region take center stage.  In the coziness of the underground Brockery, Bosworth Badger and his guests discuss the recent events over dinner and even make new, unexpected friends.  What a pity that the humans do not follow the Badger Rules of Thumb!  And what a pity that the humans never listen to what the animals have to say.  We, as the ultimate eavesdroppers, have the benefit of hearing both sides.<br /><br />Susan Wittig Albert continues to weave interesting storylines while maintaining the basics of historical integrity.

This book was written very well, and I really liked the alternating perspectives because each character had a very distinctive voice and defining personalities to set them apart from the others.

Nevertheless, I'd be lying if I didn't shed a tear....or 100...To be critical, I wish the story was a little more like the movie Titanic, where we focused a lot on the sinking and the scenery that was appearing before our character's eyes.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews I've read on it that the writing for this is much too simple, and fails to convey as much of the atmosphere and passion that it really has the potential to.  As someone else wrote as well, I do believe this is the fault of poor translation, and that this book is likely much better in its original French version.  Nonetheless, if you are looking for an easy, quick read that will probably not leave you bored, definitely give this series a try!  I loved the story, and chewed through the novels very quickly.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great concise retelling of Batman mythos", "text": "THE BATMAN ADVENTURES: THE LOST YEARS collects the full five-issue THE BAMTAN ADVENTURES: THE LOST YEARS comic magazine miniseries.<br />This story bridges the five-year gap between the end of BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES (Fox) and the start of THE NEW BATMAN ADVENTURES (Kids' WB!). Some of these plot points were told or alluded to in episodes of THE NEW BATMAN ADVENTURES or BATMAN BEYOND but they didn't go in depth as much as this book does.<br />THE LOST YEARS tells how Batgirl became an official part of Batman's team; Dick Grayson dropped his Robin persona, left Batman, and became Nightwing; and how Tim Drake became Robin. In the &quot;real&quot; comic book continuity, these events were sloppily spread out over dozens of years and creators, with filler all over the place. Here, Hilary Bader and the animated team tell the story in a much more satisfying, concise, and kid-friendly fashion, in 128 pages.<br />Forget your preconceptions of Hilary Bader -- here, she is gold. Hampton and Beatty are at the top of their form, and, of course, Ty Templeton's covers are always welcome.<br />My only problem is with the physical book: the paper is cheap and the cover's pretty wobbly. But this shouldn't be a problem for any kid or adult who reads this superb story.<br />Enjoy! // koby c.<br />P.S.

By using the quick table for German terms I discover that the meaning of Junker is &quot;a former Prussian aristocrat.&quot;  Also if you have wondered what the mathematical symbols or therapy (rolfing) terms mean the answer is in this book.
