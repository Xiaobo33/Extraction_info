{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fear of being thrown away", "text": "When something bad happens several times of course you will be afraid of it occurring once again. Your reactions are going to understandably be, to avoid situations that lead to that bad thing. Just because you're told by someone that you are safe doesn't mean you automatically believe their words. Especially someone like Kaden who has had his life twisted and turned so much he guards his very fragile heart. His manner of doing so is extremely frustrating to Theo the man who inherited him.<br /><br />How can one's brother be such a jerk? Here Theo is searching far and wide for him, following all sorts of clues and leads, but instead of finding his brother he is handed a foul smelling box with an equally stinky and foul acting cat. What the F##k?! He risked a bunch to even go to that planet and to end up with with a frigging sticky CAT! He'd probably be laughed off the ship.<br /><br />What Theo isn't aware of is that the nasty cat's really an abused Cat shifter. The shifter's plan is to get away from Theo and off the ship as soon as possible. First he has to get cleaned up, food, and a safe place to hide until he can make his escape. Cat shifters have had a terrible history and it's been in Kaden's best interest to remain a cat for many years of his life. It was often his only means of survival. Just like now.<br /><br />What is Theo going to do with this irascible cat? One who destroys his room in his absence. Who is sweet as pie to everyone except him making him seem irrational. How can he deal with a feline who is as stubborn as he is? It takes calmer sensibilities to get to the heart of the matter and tell Theo what is obvious to everyone but him. Once he gets a good sniff of the cleaned up Kitty man he makes a very startling discovery...he has found his Life Mate! Now ALL he has to do is convince his skittish Cat shifter mate that they are destined to be together. Easy peasy. Riiiight!<br /><br />How does he go about gaining the trust of a man who has victimized because of his small size, his cuteness, he being on his own, but mostly due to him being a Cat shifter? How can Theo get Kaden to believe his promises when Kaden has been persecuted all his life for something completely out of his control? Never having been in a loving relationship Theo bungles this one. Luckily for both he and his mate his friends and the ship's doctor is there to assist.<br /><br />I  didn't read the first two books in this series and I definitely felt I'd missed out on several occurrences as well as matings. It intrigued me enough to go back and read one of the previous books and continue to read future books. I enjoyed this story but I was frustrated by the lack of communication between the two MCs.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A page-turning masterpiece due to its fun narrative voice that evoked emotion and resilience.", "text": "\"Well, damn,\" is an accurate description of this book (see blurb). Gritty, brutal, exciting, and deep, The Wizard was a page-turning masterpiece due to its fun narrative voice that evoked emotion and resilience--a light in a dark fight.<br /><br />This book sucked me in from page one. Instant dragon appearance and magic, followed by political intrigue, a tad of romance, and loads of character depth? Definitely my cup of tea. I am always 100% honest in my reviews, so I devoured this book. I consumed 50% of it in a day before life's hardships interrupted my time to read. Once I was able to pick it up again, I consumed the rest, again in one sitting.<br /><br />\"Well, damn,\" is the personality of the book--yes, this book has a narrative voice full of snark and many deep emotions. So many fantasy novels these days lack that voice and focus on action and world-building, leaving us cardboard-cutout characters. This book is not that. It has a bit of everything you'd expect in fantasy but truly that voice and character depth set it apart from others. The King's Wizard, Boggs, is a man torn between his powers and morality, self-loathing for his failures and always wanting to be better. Involved with Morgan, the badass warrior princess, they team up together with others to fight a complex and interesting villain (no spoilers). The depth of the relationships and inner workings of characters' points of view is exceptional. I felt with them, rooted for them, and aligned myself with them; this narration and character depth sets aside, for me, an okay book from a great book. The Wizard is a great read.<br /><br />My only issue was the improper tense shifts, but I saw no other writing issues. At times I was lost in time and not from flashbacks because those were carefully formatted differently and done well. Overall, though, if you don't teach grammar and edit on the side like I do, you probably wouldn't notice. It did not detract from the book's enjoyment at all.<br /><br />Fantasy is known for its battles, and there are many inner and outer ones in this book. Descriptions of the magic and world were short and to the point,  but descriptive enough to paint it alive in from of me like a movie. Perfection. The ending was phenomenal (no spoilers). I am eagerly awaiting the next book because it looks like it will be at least a trilogy.<br /><br />The Wizard, by Bob Masingale, has everything one would want in a page-turning fantasy novel but its true triumph is the snarky narrative voice and world-building. \"Well, damn,\" Bob, this book was a delight.", "images": [], "asin": "B09SNZ633M", "parent_asin": "B09SNZ633M", "user_id": "AH3YIN4W3F4WURRLUA6FSSABKLEA", "timestamp": 1656992297848, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

(That background serves as a reminder for any reader who's returning to the series after long enough to need it.) For fans of the series, this is a very satisfying return to the Wide Green World and the series characters, although we spend our time only with new characters, one familiar one, and one who was only glimpsed. (We do get to hear how some events set in motion in the earlier books have progressed.)<br /><br />It's good to see how much the familiar character, Barr, has grown since our first introduction to him and our last view of him. The book shows some of that growth in progress, or perhaps Barr's growing understanding of it.<br /><br />There's suspense both personal and otherwise, but this is not one of the more plot-heavy books in the series.", "images": [], "asin": "B07N4854NX", "parent_asin": "B07N4854NX", "user_id": "AGLGI2QPUE4A5LP345MXGD5TWDKA", "timestamp": 1548527389755, "helpful_vote": 24, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Delightful!", "text": "Although the writing was simplistic the story was different from your typical love story. A very sweet tale that made me want to not only want to finish reading but to buy the sequel as well.<br /><br />After writing my initial review I read some of the others. I found it interesting that so many negative expressions of unrealistic behavior are voiced about how the relationship begins. Is Chris's situation that different from mail order brides or arranged marraiges of the past? Is it really unbelievable that someone who was spending a lot of money to reach a goal wouldn't use whatever tools were available to increase the odds of a positive result? Just because will inhibiting or mind altering substances are frowned on in this culture that doesn't mean that someone from another world would have a problem using them. Why is it so unbelievable that Caitlyn wouldn't be able to adjust to her new life after experiencing such a substance? I still enjoyed the premise if the tale. I especially enjoyed the way the two aliens were so different in their thought processes. People from the same place can see things very differently and won't respond the same way to stimuli.<br /><br />I stand by my rating. Chris wanted to be a partner with his mate not dominate and rule everything.  He focused on learning about his mate in particular while his friend had a different approach to reaching a similar goal and focused on learning how this world works. It was exactly like the difference between the way a single person views life differently than a married person.", "images": [], "asin": "B0057CTR14", "parent_asin": "B0057CTR14", "user_id": "AG5IV7DGP2RN3NBEVIXXMVMLQIBA", "timestamp": 1492785162000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It was one of my most anticipated books for 2021, so I added it instantly, and it didn\u2019t disappoint! \u2063<br />\u2063<br />I really liked Evie. Her reasons for her cynicism and distrust for love, especially as a teenager, made so much sense to me and were even relatable to an extent. I loved her friends and how different they all were from one another but fit together so well. Then of course there is X. He\u2019s so different from Evie, with his belief in only saying yes, and they work. They make sense, and I loved them together. Add in the hilarious dance instructor, Fifi and you have a mix of characters. \u2063<br />\u2063<br />Nicola Yoon is funny. She has a way of describing things with sarcasm that really resonates with me, but she is also great at adding depth to a book and she certainly made me cry with this one. I\u2019ve mentioned a thousand times that I am a fan of a romance that isn\u2019t 100% happy and she delivered for me.\u2063<br />\u2063<br />I loved the magical realism in this, and I like that it wasn\u2019t explained what it was, how it worked, or really even why it was there.

Her stories always suck me in and have me reluctant to put the book down, even at 4 am. Unspoken continues her legacy of great reads full of romance, suspense and faith.<br /><br />Faith is a topic that is always very strong in Dee's books, but maybe not in the traditional way some come to expect from Christian novels. It's not all about non-believer meets believer and a soul is saved, although there's certainly nothing wrong with that. I love those tales too. But what I appreciate about Dee's books, is that whether the character is a believer or not, or maybe just questioning - it's about the personal journey. You see inside their hearts and minds, you know them deep inside and understand their struggles with life. You understand how they can believe so strongly despite a horrid past event or maybe how that past event could be hindering their growth. Either way, it's insight. That insight makes you connect to the story on a deeper level and you can't help but feel the tension, romance, suspense and frustration stronger when you're connected at that level to the character. I also appreciate that with each story there is spiritual growth in some measure and I know I can't help but carry that with me to think on later when the story is done.<br /><br />So how can I not love a Dee Henderson novel? Unspoken has all the above - and I get a great romantic suspense with a good looking guy that makes my heart want to pitter-patter a little harder when he walks onto the page.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with a Dee Henderson book.

Her Incubus Master was the perfect reintroduction. I would also like to say this was my first ever audiobook, and I was pleasantly surprised. At first, it was a bit weird. I am not much for dirty talk, so hearing this mature voiced gentleman saying such scandalous things almost stopped my heart! I made the mistake of listening to it while I was driving and had to stop before I wrecked my car! Not seriously, but I dare you to listen to this without being affected.<br /><br />In this story, Devlin brings her expertise in BDSM to her skillful storytelling. Andras is not only a skilled Master, but a considerate one as well. While I felt that Katie didn\u2019t particularly stand out as far as heroines go, I was envious of her. Their relationship felt real and heartfelt, regardless of what they were doing.<br /><br />There are a lot of BDSM erotica out there, but Devlin\u2019s Children of Lilith is among the best, especially if you like a little fantasy and magic to go along with it.", "images": [], "asin": "B00LBACNQW", "parent_asin": "B00LBACNQW", "user_id": "AHT4LNBZVBGOTAVEPGFCY2PSWS5A", "timestamp": 1456889922000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Okay but also kind of disappointing because of Caspion :P", "text": "2.5-3 stars<br /><br />***Spoiler warning!!! I go into some details in this review so please don't read if you want to avoid spoilers***<br /><br />This story was rather disappointing... I will admit that I already had issues with Caspion's behavior in Shadow's Claim. He seemed selfish and immature and I didn't like how he treated Bettina at all. I was hoping that he'd be better in this book but TBH, Caspion pretty much ruined any possibility that this book could get a higher rating from me. I seriously did consider giving it a lower rating but the story itself and the other characters don't deserve that...just Caspion.<br /><br />So, those that have read the previous book (Shadow's Claim) know that Caspion is a tracker that was friends with Bettina and ended up entering the competition for her hand in marriage (in Shadow's Claim) to avoid a death he was marked for because he left the land of Dacia (which is forbidden). This story takes place both before and after that event.<br /><br />Basically, Caspion is screwing around at an orgy when he catches the eye of Mirceo, who is a vampire and the Prince of Dacia. Mirceo invites him over and he declines but Mirceo persists. Caspion indicates he's straight and he and Mirceo become best buddies and spend a few weeks or so together, visiting all the brothels and orgies they can. They feel a strong connection and so obviously, Mirceo says &#34;It must be because you're destined for my sister. Come to Dacia to meet her but be warned, once you enter our land, you can't leave or you'll be killed&#34; (paraphrased but that's basically it). Caspion decides his instincts are telling him to go to Dacia so he does...only to find that Mirceo's sister isn't his mate after all. Something intimate happens between Caspion and Mirceo and Caspion ;eaves Dacia and goes running home with death on his heals and that's where Shadow's Claim comes in.<br /><br />After his defeat in the competition, Caspion can't deal and so he goes off to a demon realm where time works differently to gain strength and money. A week or so in our time is 500 years or so in that realm so Caspion comes back much stronger and more confident than he was before. Mirceo had actually been trying to find him before he left for the other realm and instead, found him after he had come back. While they were apart, Mirceo had lost his heartbeat and suspected that Caspion was his mate and indeed, Mirceo was &#34;blooded&#34; (regained his heartbeat) when he got near Caspion, proving Caspion is his mate.<br /><br />This starts a long line of denial, denial, denial. Caspion basically used every reason he could think of as to why they couldn't be mates, most of which were completely unfair. Also, since Caspion was technically much older than Mirceo after his time in the other realm, he seemed to feel the need to treat Mirceo like a child or something. He kept calling Mirceo names like Leechling, which seemed not only demeaning but also condescending. Also, Caspion couldn't seem to decide whether Mirceo was his BFF or a hated enemy...it seemed to vary by mood.<br /><br />I'm not saying Mirceo was perfect, he made his mistakes and some were doozies. However, Caspion made a ton of assumptions about Mirceo and they were just a bunch of crap and it made it very difficult for Mirceo to even begin to prove himself to Caspion. Caspion tried to say that he knew Mirceo better than he knew himself when Caspion only really know him while they were partying together for a while and he saw that as the sum total of Mirceo and nothing else mattered to him.<br /><br />Sorry I got a little carried away with my annoyance about Caspion but he just realy bothered me... Thankfully, this crap did get settled (but not until the very end) and Mirceo and Caspion end up together and heading towards a HEA (although the story does end with a cliffy concerning Mirceo's sister).", "images": [], "asin": "B01JQ0SH6S", "parent_asin": "B01JQ0SH6S", "user_id": "AE3BMQVT7IAUDCXU2HIXNYAQNRDQ", "timestamp": 1493117314000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This book seemed so realistic, with real people and real life problems. No cheesy outlandish problem solving. Every issue was handled the way that real life goes, good or bad.  Real life throws things at you rather you are ready for it or not and you can't go back and change the decision you made at that time because you've already set off the chain of events. Legacy is a perfect example of that.<br />I smiled, I cried, and then I smiled through my tears....", "images": [], "asin": "B00WAME2MS", "parent_asin": "B00WAME2MS", "user_id": "AF2DISZE54JOOSCQ5CQFQ2YYKAJA", "timestamp": 1463062878000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Enjoyable Read", "text": "I came across this selection by accident through Amazon's free kindle books available and I enjoyed it so much that I had to complete the series with books #2 and #3 immediately after.  The Lunarmorte series is, as I understand it, this author's first attempt at writing and she did a fantastic job.  I fell in love with the characters and their struggles and found myself dying to see the story through.  It is a fantasy story, so expect some parts to be a bit over the top in the fantasy realm and the main character is a bit ... \"fantastical\".  With that being said, I enjoyed the way that Young adds the romance and bonding aspect without being too vulgar, repeatedly brings the characters back to earth with more humble, human qualities and wraps it up in an enjoyable mixture of action and suspense.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys stories about the supernatural realm of werewolves, vampires and fairies, but doesn't want the in-your-face sexual encounters of a \"Sookie Stackhouse\" novel.  I recommend it for adults and older teens keeping in mind that there are sexual situations and violence that may not be appropriate for the younger groups and I would say that it is very comparable to the \"House of Night\" series.  I gave it a five star rating, not based on the complexity or other technical critiques, but based on how much I enjoyed reading it.  If you enjoy losing yourself to another world for a while, I completely recommend losing yourself with Caia and friends in the Lunarmorte series.", "images": [], "asin": "B004HO5W2G", "parent_asin": "B004HO5W2G", "user_id": "AGXTUFFYYKH3HIYDB7OK5Q37II2Q", "timestamp": 1338890938000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Rand's Pernicious Nonsense (makes a try) in \"Continuance\";", "text": "Those seeking a genuine appraisal of the \"works\" of Ayn Rand, may like to look over this offering - revealing nothing new and thereby everything about itself -  at the same time.  Although similarly sickeningly and one-eyed beyond reason as is the rest of the \"collection\" to a functioning mind, it starts to become too evident for even her supporters to pretend to ignore the fact that there WAS no new information coming from the \"House of Rand\" -  because none existed.  Far from being groundbreaking (unless you're talking digging up corpses), it was old before it got \"reworked\" for the first let alone the 457th incarnation of the same old idle repetitions.<br /><br />In between yet another endless quoting and re-quoting of herself, and her earlier rather horrendously skewed \"texts\" she misnomered to be \"For the (New) Intellectual\" among other treasonous covers, Rand/Rosenbaum continues on her hellbent course to tell all ('mankind', or 'men qua men'?) already browbeaten into further hearing her, even then as if from \"beyond the grave\", that she understood how a process of \"automatizing\" (or \"automization\") in her sublanguage could stand-in for a natural and able cognitive development.<br /><br />Far from describing growth in real human terms, it is precisely that which \"Rand\" sought to overtake and supplant with an overcalling sub-variety of unoriginal and reductionist terms that would render the human mind as if prefigured by some form of faked and non-functional (anti-any and all sort of) \"nano-technology\".  Primitively so.  Cloning as it \"goes\".  Always as if \"speaking\" from before the event, as if pre-cognitively, while claiming to be against that - and just about everything else, excepting, (prater) naturally, ONLY and however \"strictly\" -  itself.<br /><br />The \"Rand\" ploy in a nutshell.  Try to falsely divide and accuse part of your 'audience' (which you don't bother to visualize but in a dull and warping mirror) of that which you are 'yourself'.  Then restate it another several hundred times, in as many variations as you can mock up, all amounting to the same 'nothing' that 'you' overcall as everything else - and (as if pretending to be over)  everyone else.  Nothing more than a badly fractured and imploded dead-ended remains of what once may have had the chance to be an intellect if not so badly gutted and inverted by its own hand.  Pretending blindness and omniscience in the same notional fell (and foul) swoop.<br /><br />It's the worst kind of pretender and fake valuer that must be against (its own job lot of a) \"something\" to be anything at all.  It claims a false type of ultra fanatical and farcical \"positivism\" which is negated by its \"own\" stance.  It then engages in a further pretense (and twist) to label that which it \"identifies\" by its own thoroughly irrational and absurd \"standard\" as \"an\" \"other\" that it pretends to defeat over and over again.  In one vital sense, it does.  In entirely self-defeatest terms pretending by a game of false opposites to lay a claim to the entire field of human cognition.  Yet another \"divide\" and try \"rule\", strategist, this \"one\" all the more foul for attempting to hide it from 'herself'.  Furthermore, for trying to use the human race as fodder to do it.  Moreover, those in an otherwise free world, to whatever degree beyond her canting that tries reduce the entire sum to a false equation by means of an equally false elevation of a minor few.  Even the language of the offering above continues in this same (old) vein (which could better be spelled 'VAIN'), using such immortal words as the  \"all too few heroically minded\" to 'amp up' her none-too-few followers with a prosaic kind of \"lift\".  Too bad by the time many of them could have realized it was as if a shove of the head under, many have given up the ability to 'see' anything except through her sadly demented eyes, and split \"vision\" accordingly.<br /><br />Utterly foul stuff and perhaps the greatest fake - and mass of self-delusion and false self projection I've had the misfortune to come across.<br /><br />It is true that \"Rand\" did attempt to \"suck up\" (there are no other words to describe her maneuver to try an \"appeal\") to individual and genuinely independent minds, and human values with the same blow on the side of the head as just now outlined and as only she best 'described' it.  The \"collection\" \"repurposed\" so as to be on offer above to those of her converted persuasion has since (and already manifestly) revealed itself as an all too apparent truly PRIMITIVE  subset of its own disturbed kind of whack - literally -  that is the only \"thing\" \"Rand\" truly \"knew\" anything about.<br /><br />No matter how she (or her latter-day mouthpieces) try to re-doctor her tired out, old and failed expressions, they still have yet to produce anything original - or anything at all that's not defined as idle and empty repetition and regurgitation.  That's about (and rather exactly) all it's good for.  Proof positive, in this \"volume\" offered above, and many others almost identical in form, content, expression and \"integrating\" power.  A zilch, which is to say, yet another notional vacuum.<br /><br />Only best left un-stomached, as all it does is upset the digestion.", "images": [], "asin": "B002OSXDAK", "parent_asin": "B002OSXDAK", "user_id": "AHB4DYDAATO52MXMYUJ6VAMFFY4A", "timestamp": 1381845255000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Imaginative premise!", "text": "I enjoyed this one.  The description of this book really appealed to me from the start so I thought it would be worth a try.  I was really curious about how the ability to see when your relationship with someone would end would play out in a story, and I think that it worked pretty well.  This was a really quick read, and I found it to be quite enjoyable.<br /><br />When Quinn touches someone for the first time, she sees how that relationship will end.  She knows if it will be a long term relationship or if it will end quickly.  I thought that this was a really interesting ability and it made sense that it would have a big impact on Quinn's life.  Do you go out on a date with someone you know will break your heart?  Unfortunately, even though she knows what is going to happen, she can't do anything to stop it.<br /><br />Quinn meets Griffin at an art gallery.  They are both there to find inspiration: Quinn for her photography and Griffin for his music.  When she touches him, she sees that he will die soon while telling her that he loves her.  As fate would have it, she soon learns that he lives in the same apartment complex as she lives with her grandmother.  They are drawn to each other and love spending time with each other but Quinn is afraid that she might be the cause of his upcoming death.<br /><br />I liked the characters in this book.  Quinn had been through a lot in her life and her special abilities have not made things any easier for her.  Griffin has had his own challenges and is trying to start fresh on his own in a different state.  It really seemed like these two needed each other and I thought that they were good together.  Quinn's friend Olivia was a good source of support for her and her new boyfriend, Jack, seemed like a good guy as well.<br /><br />I do wish that we would have had the chance to see Quinn have to deal with her powers more often in this book.  I only remember it happening twice in the story and I think it would have made the story more interesting if it came up more often.  I didn't find the mystery to be too hard to figure out but I was still eager to see how things played out.  There were a couple of times in the story when things felt a little too convenient but nothing that I couldn't look past.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "I wanted to like this so much I preordered it but it was bad", "text": "I LOVE the ACOTAR trilogy. I reread it at least 1-2x/ year. And, as much as I loved the trilogy, I hated the novella aka \"ACOTAR a Christmas Special.\" The novella took a character I found interesting and broke her and made her near irredeemable. I still preordered this book tho, in the hopes that I could forget the novella existed and really enjoy this s one. I was SORELY disappointed.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />The first 75% of this book was a slog fest. I picked it up and out it down over a dozen times. All of the things I loved about the earlier books-- fleshed out side characters, Cassian as a capable General, the rich world lore-- was just...absent. The only spot of interest in this section is the visit to the bog. Outside of that the action falls into two categories: Nesta's anger at herself & everyone else, and exotic sex with Cassian.  When I say erotic, I mean erotic. I'm not exaggerating. We are treated to the location of someone's bodily fluids in nearly every sex scene, of which there are dozens. And, because so much space is spent on sex and internal conflict there is too little space given to nearly everything else. For example, Nesta makes 2 friends and other than their names and homes we learn nothing else about them until the Blood Rite in the last 25% of the book. Nothing new happens with any of the side characters Amen, Vassa, Lucien, Elaine, Ariel, Mor, Eric, Tamlin or Koschei. There is some vague stuff regarding each of them but nothing to hook readers for more like in the trilogy.<br /><br />And there is a subplot I need to rant about because it's SO stupid. After the novella we all know that Feyre's pregnant. The subplot involves Feyre's and the baby's lives being in danger bc the baby has wings and thus Rhys's life being in danger bc of his bargain with Feyre to die when she dies. Feyre is a SHAPESHIFTER. Also she's MATED to Rhys. BOTH of these things make this subplot beyond stupid. If it's dangerous to give birth Feyre would not be his mate. Which, is also true for Cassian and Nesta. Matehood is supposed to help ensure genetically better offspring, which is impossible if mother and child die from the process. Also, Feyre is a SHAPESHIFTER. It's what she is, amongst other things. What good is her power if she can't use it. So dumb. And because it's so dumb it robs Nesta's sacrifice to save them of most of its meaning.<br /><br />Which brings me to the last 25% of the book. It was great. I couldn't out it down. Right up until Nesta traded her powers away to save two people who only needed saving because the subplot was ridiculous. In the original trilogy every subplot added something. In this book it managed to take away from one of just 3 times when Nesta purposefully<br />flexed her powers. Btw, we are never told the full extent of powers and then they are gone.<br /><br />Finally, as a whole, I disliked the plot and what it did to the main characters. Cassian and Nesta lost their identities and became Rhys-and-Feyre-lite but with kinkier sex.<br /><br />In sum, nearly everything about this book was worse than the novella. Not even in the same stratosphere as books 1-3. There was so much potential from the trilogy and the space of a full-length novel and what was produced felt like someone else, less experienced, wrote it. I don't understand the high reviews. It really feels like the author was done after book 3 and was forced to keep writing. There's no heart in it anymore.<br /><br />Hence, 1 star.", "images": [], "asin": "B08CHNCDN5", "parent_asin": "B08CHNCDN5", "user_id": "AGTAEDFFWERQNBXUOFG3QSLSVGUQ", "timestamp": 1618875195832, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Deja Vu All Over Again", "text": "I've never read anything by Stephen Ambrose until now, but with his reputation was eager to read this account of building the transcontinental railroad.  He packs the pages with extensive background facts, ties it to other history of the time, and then to make sure you don't forget them, repeats them countless times, chapter after chapter, except typically with nuances of difference.  The end result is you're never really sure what's accurate.  Just like the saying \"a man with one watch knows what time it is; a man with two is never really sure.\"<br /><br />Truth is, I discounted other reviewer comments here based on Ambrose's notoriety.  But the reality is after slogging through 12 chapters, I'll keep going for the six more to complete the story.<br /><br />That said, here's the real takeaway.  The book has 17 chapters and an epilogue.  Each of them have multiple sections.  Each section seems to be written as a standalone account of some aspect of building the transcontinental railroad.  But(!!!)...nobody, no editor, no publisher, not even the writer himself does much to give them the luxury of any continuity of flow nor do anything to cross out factoids already said many times over.  Say it once or twice and I'll probably remember it.  Say it five or ten times...odds are I'm confused with a frequent sense of deja vu.  Frankly that's both irritating and insulting.  And it's a shame, because he has a great deal of facts and interesting side stories.  But organization of the manuscript is sadly lacking.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Really impressed by this character-driven mystery novel", "text": "It's just another day in Mount Oanoke, Pennsylvania when the birds start to fall. Hundreds of dead starlings, dropping from the sky during a baseball game. It seems like the birds started it all, but really the secrets and lies began much earlier. Nate Winters, high school teacher and baseball coach, is beloved in the town. That is, until a reporter, in town to cover the birds, catches Nate hugging a student at a local motel. Suddenly, the birds are forgotten, and the story becomes much juicier: Nate; his student, Lucia; and their supposed affair. Lucia fuels the fire by affirming the affair and suddenly Nate and his wife, Alecia, are swept up in the story. The only who believes in Nate's innocence, even a sliver, is his friend and co-worker, Bridget. As Lucia's creative writing teacher, she has unique insight into the girl's mind. But when Lucia suddenly goes missing--with Nate as the prime suspect in her disappearance--not even Bridget may be able to save Nate. But is there more to Lucia's disappearance than an affair with her teacher?<br /><br />Wow, I was really impressed by this novel. It's a complicated novel that is just as much a character-driven study as it is a mystery. It's incredibly well-written, and Moretti expertly embodies the voice of each of her characters, from beleaguered Alecia, who is worn down from mothering her autistic son, Gabe; to the cast of teenager characters; to Bridget, who lost her husband to cancer a year ago. It's so well-done that often with each chapter (which skip from various points of view -- Bridget, Kate, Lucia, Nate, etc.), I found my myself veering between whom I preferred or believed, constantly second-guessing my allegiances or what happened. This is very rare for me: typically I find my &#34;person&#34; in a novel and stick with them, no matter what.<br /><br />But here, I was confused, wondering. Was Nate really a cad, who cheated on his wife every second he got, or was he the sweet, affable teacher and baseball coach that the whole town admired and adored? And Alecia--was she more than just a weary mom, broken down by years of staying at home with her autistic son, Gabe, unable to give to anyone beyond him? Did she push Nate away, into the arms of others? Or was the truth more complicated that all of this? I have to hand it to Moretti--she was excellent at creating confusion and doubt. In addition to different perspectives, the novel shifts in time (before the birds fell, after the birds fell, before Lucia disappeared, etc.). It's a little tough to keep track of, but it also keeps you on your toes and always wondering, as you piece various parts of the puzzle together.<br /><br />For me--even more than the mystery of what exactly happened with Lucia--the strength of this novel was the writing and the characters. I felt for them, even when I was frustrated with them. Moretti captures the angst and meanness of high school extremely well, portraying the cliques of a small town quite superbly. (I was reminded of WHEN WE WERE WORTHY, which I just finished.) I loved the juxtaposition of this being a small town, so the idea is that everyone knows everyone and everything, and yet there are so many secrets, so much unknown. Being a witness to Alecia and Nate's marriage is amazing-- you see firsthand how the events affect them and how they've reached this point. It's an incredibly realistic portrayal of marriage and of motherhood.<br /><br />As you probably tell, I just really liked this novel. It's very well-written, with quite compelling characters. I worked out some of the plot, but it didn't stop me from reading at all. I think some of the emphasis on character development slows the story at places, but not in any detrimental way. This one will make you think, as well as intrigue you with what happened to Lucia. Quite worth the read.<br /><br />I received a copy of this novel from the publisher and Netgalley (thank you!) in return for an unbiased review.", "images": [], "asin": "B01MD0SGHS", "parent_asin": "B01MD0SGHS", "user_id": "AF2YMA33EUBQTMUGIS2AXMEUTHXA", "timestamp": 1509738413583, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful Read", "text": "If you're looking for a beautifully written and clean historical romance set in the 1850s, this one is for you. The characters touched my heart and made me feel as if I was a part of their little town in Mesquite Springs. Evelyn is a strong character who relies on her strengths and independence to make it through the good and bad situations in her life. Wyatt amplifies her persona with his good nature, quick thinking and humble atmosphere. Together they captured everything beautiful about a natural growing connection. Little Polly melted my heart with her desire to find the perfect daddy and overcome the loss of her family at such a young age.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself sucked into the history of Evelyn and Polly. I wasn't expecting the mystery surrounding the orphans and the heart squeezing trials of forgiveness. I found comfort in their inner struggles as they grew together. This novel was surprisingly action packed and left me guessing who \"The Watcher\" was as the plot unfolded. An overall easy read encompassing the ideals of 1850 small town life and the growth of family and friends through love and understanding.<br /><br />I received this novel from Revell Reads in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I am so happy to finally get Owen\u2019s story, but so sad because it brings an end to the Accidental Billionaires series.  Endeared is book 5 in the Accidental Billionaires series.  It tells the story of Owen Sinclair, the youngest of the Sinclair clan, and Layla, who was once Owen\u2019s best friend.  Owen, Andie (from Enchanted, Accidental Billionaires, book 4) and Layla were friends from school.  Owen had feelings for Layla in high school, but did not say anything because he was afraid to lose her friendship, and as soon as he graduated he was leaving for medical school.  Layla also had a crush on Owen, but never said anything because she did not want to lose his friendship.  Layla has a horrible situation at home, and never shared it with anyone.  As high school is ending there are events that happen to Layla, which ruins everything she had planned for herself after high school, and she fully blames Owen for these events.  Owen has been away for years attending medical school and focusing on getting through his residency and has not really seen his family.  He has tried to reach out to Layla, but has never heard from her.  Ten years later and Owen is now a doctor and is returning home to Citrus Beach and will be taking over the clinic there, and much to his surprise, his high school friend Layla is the nurse practitioner there.  He never really focused on his billionaire status; as he was too busy becoming a doctor.  Now back home and Owen feels a disconnect with his family, does not know how to handle being a billionaire, and he really wants to find out why Layla hates him so much. That is all I am saying, so I do not spoil it for anyone.  Endeared is everything I hoped for and more.  The character development is perfect.  You will be experiencing a lot of emotions with Owen and Layla\u2019s story.  J. S. Scott is an amazing author, and you can always count on drama, plans being hatched, groveling, hot steamy scenes, did I mention groveling, and a wonderful ending.  I am a huge fan of J. S. Scott.  I have read all of her books, and not one of them has left me disappointed.  I highly recommend Endeared.  A definite must read!  You will not be disappointed.  Thank you J. S.

Yet, in his new novel The Prometheus Frontier Kevin Osborne has ingeniously accomplished both.  By setting his tale in a fantastical sci-fi environment with time portals, futuristic holo-lasic technology, and \u201cnormal\u201d transportation via private air vehicles (AVs) that fly and hover up-down-all-around like the playful \u201cLong Birds\u201d that occasionally grace the narrative with their beauty and charm.<br />And by sharing experiences of the main character, young Alek Rankil, the story takes us on an historical and present-day exploration both physically and socially of a miraculous island named Ar\u00eate--the Greek word meaning \u201cexcellence and moral virtue.\u201d  Alek is chosen to become one of the leaders of this diminutive Caribbean retreat, so he must learn about the genesis of its formation, its foundational principles, and its future plans to secure and administer a fully consistent, fully free \u201ccountry\u201d before accepting or refusing the mission offered to him and becoming a member of the Paine Society (named after American patriot Thomas Paine, who declared: \u201cWe have it in our power to begin the world over again\u201d).  This clever plot line executed by use of the in-and-out-of-time portals coupled with back-in-reality scenes for factual information and exciting experiences, of course, gives readers the opportunity to learn right along with Alek.<br />Giving obscure names to the huge cast of larger-than-life but believable characters, Osborne prevents us from discerning the origin, background, or ethnicity of most of them; thus, the whole population in the novel takes on an international flavor, making the theme of \u201cliberty and reason\u201d as necessities for mutual civility and personal happiness a universal one. Subtly personalized throughout, these ground-breaking pioneers of the spirit are no cardboard characters spouting philosophy like Ivory-tower donkeys laden with books; they live and love just like real-life individuals, and we get to know them as superbly intelligent but sensitive souls to care about.<br />The novel is saturated with science\u2014microbiology, DNA Nanoscience, bioweaponry, and more\u2014but each discipline has its part to play in this intellectual drama that delights the eye as much as it challenges the mind by including fascinating illustrations (the author also is an artist) both on the cover of the book and punctuating the text inside, all rendered with esoteric Chinese ink brushes to add a bit of light whimsy to the deeper conceptual theme.<br />Ar\u00eate flies its flag of freedom bearing an image of the actual \u201cPerpetual Flame\u201d that burns eternally in its harbor in tribute to the Fire that the great titan Prometheus brought to humans in Greek mythology.  When the flame turns color, inhabitants know by that signal that their tiny haven has been attacked. . .but by what and from whom they must now discover.<br />We are given hints early on by introductions to a philosophically opposite\u2014totalitarian-collectivist-- society named the One World organization and known as \u201cPangaia\u201d (Greek for \u201cAll Earth\u201d) that its operatives may be the culprits.  But the damage already done is massive and increasing by the minute with imminent death at everyone\u2019s door, so time is of the essence not only to create a rapid method of defense but also to find the source of the thousands of fatal \u201cweapons\u201d threatening extinction and the perpetrators who created and unleashed them.<br />The stakes are high and the tension is tight in this novel of ideas turned skillfully into an action film that pits not just a good and bad guy against each other but makes the outcome of the conflict monumental because it\u2019s two philosophies of life itself that are clashing before us on our mental movie screen.<br />The scope of crossing from past to present to future is a real achievement as Osborne charts a path from ancient Greece to tomorrow.  It\u2019s a long and ideationally thorny path but he makes us believe that the arduous journey is worth it, and he helps by identifying, targeting, and showing why and how to philosophically obliterate the ever re-sprouting thorns of piercingly injurious ideas to happiness and human welfare in order to (at last) clear the way to \u201ca most excellent place.\u201d<br />All in all, this ambitious \u201cphilosophical thriller\u201d is told in high style by a historically knowledgeable, imaginatively thinking, truth-seeking, romantic wordsmith who delivers his mighty subject with great humanity and the gentle touch of a poet. I can\u2019t help but think that along with others who will be introduced for the first time to this life-affirming-modern-age-philosophy via such a captivating novel that the brilliant woman who originated the actual philosophy being explored in a sci-fi setting might well have enjoyed the fictional ride as much as I did.", "images": [], "asin": "B095G5Y7YV", "parent_asin": "B095G5Y7YV", "user_id": "AHDI4EHTDW5APDDVX26HM34GUFCA", "timestamp": 1635456890994, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

You're so lost in her world, the characters and their story; its nearly impossible to recover from it. And then you realize..you have to go back to the real world.<br />Welcome to the Cameo Hotel is one of those books that you get completely lost in.  I couldn't put it down, I was so captivated. Gavin and Emma's story was intoxicating.  It was unexpected in all the right ways.  The sexual tension was dripping off of my e-reader. Their chemistry and dynamic with one another was so magnetic, I inhaled every single word deep down to my bones.<br />Gavin is an up and coming CEO staying in the hotel where Emma is the reception manager.  What could possibly happen between these two? They're complete opposites, it seems. Both in life and on the social scale. But the more you read and get to know these characters, you find yourself seeing that they're the same in so many ways.<br />Gavin Grayson. What. A. Man. Self-assured, demanding, arrogant, completely alpha and yummy. You know those smoldering, sexy types - ones used to getting their way? Yeah. Imagine that tied up in a beautiful, sexy package. *sigh* Can Gavin be mine?<br />And Emma. She has to be one of my favorite characters. She's independent, smart, strong, loyal and so incredibly likable. The type of girl you want as your best friend. I fell in love with her spirit and tenacity. When these two collide, the fire sparks, and there is no turning back.<br />Welcome to the Cameo Hotel is a GREAT read. Gavin and Emma's story was unexpected, wonderfully written, with the best characters. It had everything to keep you entertained, and brought out the feels.

The pictures, descriptions, and recipes all feel personal and have been included in the book with love and care. These are the recipes you've always wanted. Ones that get handed down generation to generation. These are the ones you whip up in a jiffy because friends are popping by for a cup of tea. The  ones you have on the counter and cut slices out of to nibble on all day. The recipes are not fussy and very versatile. Most of which you will have the ingredients for at home. I love that different ingredients can be swapped in and cakes can be paired with different toppings for a variety of variations of each cake.  I tried the Versatile Coconut Cake (p.44) with Nana's Simple Glaze -Coconut variation (p.70). The cake was easy to make. I pretty much mixed it in one bowl. The cake was soft, moist, and flavorful. I ate a piece for breakfast with a cup of hot tea, then nibbled on a piece after lunch, then after dinner, and then poof it was finished. I can't wait to make the next recipe. I'm eyeing the Lovely Lemon Yogurt Cake (p.48), Tangy Olive Oil Cake (p.40), Milk and Honey Cake (p.36).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good, Just", "text": "In His Image digs deep into some of the major the characteristics of God and how we can and should be reflections of Him to the world. The book looks at God Most Holy, Loving, Good, Just, Merciful, Gracious, Faithful, Patient, Truthful, and Wise. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t come as a shock to you, that even though we are created in His image, we are not (nor will we be) perfectly like Him. As sinners, we are in need of a Savior. While Jesus comes in and changes our hearts, we will still wrestle with sin in our life. That doesn\u2019t mean we should embrace it or brush it under the rug as nothing, but it should be active in our minds to turn from our sins and strive to be more Christ-like.<br /><br />Jen uses practical, real-life stories to explain deep, theological principles. Just as Jesus spoke in parables, we can begin to understand complex truths we don\u2019t fully understand, when they are explained using stories we do. She also used plenty of scriptures to back up what she was saying. She gave God\u2019s Word the ultimate authority and not merely our life understandings.<br /><br />One piece that stuck out to me in the book was when Jen talked about our desire for God\u2019s will in our life. How often do we go to God and ask Him \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Not saying we should never pray that, but she poses that we should ask the question \u201cWho should I be?\u201d Our desire for God\u2019s will in our lives should be more than just knowing what to physically do in this life, but about transforming our hearts to be more like Christ. She says \u201cwithout meaning to, we can begin to regard our relationship with God primarily as a means toward decision making.\u201d<br /><br />I appreciate how the book was written to not only teach, but encourage and correct. First she shares about how God is each of the characteristics for the chapters. Then she shares both how we should and how we shouldn\u2019t live, to be a better image-bearer of Him. She doesn\u2019t pretend to be perfect herself, but instead shares her own flaws and need for Jesus. She also doesn\u2019t shy away from sharing things we probably need to be actively convicted on to change in our lives (ex: patience). God doesn\u2019t expect us to be perfect, but if Jesus has truly changed our hearts, it should change how we act and think in this life.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "I didn't really start enjoying this book until  more than halfway through.", "text": "I love adventure stories, and am particularly partial to those that feature the Amazon Jungle and River.  By all rights I should have loved this story.  It wasn't until near the very end, I began to actually enjoy STATE OF WONDER.<br /><br /> For most of the book, I really had a hard time finding any empathy for the  shallow, self absorbed characters.  Most of them are academics focused on their careers (trying to develop the can't-miss drug that will give women the ability to bear children much later in life.)<br /><br />The author did turn things around for me in the last quarter of the book when an unexpected plot twist and a deepening friendship between the two main characters redeemed things, and made up for some of the plausibility and flow issues in the plot.<br /><br />The main character, Marina, is, for most of the book, a shallow boring woman who, though clearly brilliant, keeps her relationship with her much older boss (a widower) hidden from everyone she knows.  He has so little regard for her that he is willing to risk her life to raise stock prices in the drug company they both work for.  He has no problem with this, even though one employee has already died, and his grand plan has little chance of success.  Marina, who is hoping for a marriage proposal, appears pathetic and weak by allowing herself to be manipulated into something she does not want to do, and may end up killing her.<br /><br />The background of Marina's life is partially conveyed to the reader  by a constant flo-interrupting series of nightmares, that are neither frightening, interesting or even necessary.  They just interrupt the pacing.  I hate when women are conveyed as weak, and are easily manipulated by men who inevitably, take more than they give.<br /><br />The other main female character is a rude ball-buster, who also followed a selfish man, right up until he died.  There has to be a happy medium between a woman that won't stand up for herself and one that will not compromise or make any effort or concessions to anybody.  Both are unflattering depictions of women and just not realistic.  Both women were much more likeable by the end of the story, though they continued making poor choices.<br /><br />If you want to really like STATE OF WONDER, you'll have to stick with it, because the ending is the best part.", "images": [], "asin": "B004G8QZSS", "parent_asin": "B004G8QZSS", "user_id": "AEJVCG5LPO4AITZXXLCT6A2ILDRA", "timestamp": 1622142276711, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

The characterization is shallow, visual world building non-existent, and a plot arc as appealing as week-old bread.<br /><br />If you are a hockey fan, do not read this book. The author characterizes the male lead with implausible stereotypes  related to professional athletes. The female lead, a pastry chef, gets the opposite treatment with almost no backstory. Their banter feels forced and the &#34;chemistry&#34; of their interactions falls flat.<br /><br />The plot feels both rushed and contrived.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Young & Simple", "text": "Well, I'm torn. I picked this up because of another Review that compared it to one of my favorites, &#34;Crown/Court Duel&#34;. This book definitely has many of the same winning combinations as CD, but with only one book some of he better aspects are rushed or replaced by the greater fantastical world-building. If it hadn't been for the shining praise and my similarly high expectations, I probably would have liked this much more. As it was, I still finished it in a day.<br /><br />Back to the comparison: There is definitely a court setting, political intrigue and balls that one would expect. Sometimes, though, the politics are confusingly at once superficially treated and at the same time unavoidably important to the plot. I found myself on more than one occasion confused by character's partial statements and the myriad of important figures and their positions.<br /><br />While the heroine is spunky, independent and definitely likeable, it would have been nice to see a little more wit and or banter--the second half of the book's more serious nature didn't seem to allow for this though. Finally, along those lines, while there is some romance, most of the book is taken up with the heroine's blatant refusal to marry and her following refusal to flirt. In the end, then, it seems more geared to a younger reader due to the storyline's simplicity--think of a Jane Austen-like quick resolution. The tightly wrapped up ending accentuates this feeling of simplicity despite some absolutely horrid creations of character that evoke real feelings of hatred in the reader.<br /><br />A recommended light read, but not as good as CD.", "images": [], "asin": "B000OCXG32", "parent_asin": "B000OCXG32", "user_id": "AHAQCIZ32RK2ZNEJM2XDZ4BTJ2LQ", "timestamp": 1432586126000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

As always, Litton has a way of weaving beautiful words with a compelling, edgy story that isn't for everyone. She mentions that this is her darkest story yet, and I truly think she shines brightest when she's delving into this world. Such stunning writing style paired with such rich, developed characters -- her work is an absolute delight.<br /><br />I found the main character, our fiendish Lord, to be appropriately terrible, but in a way you can connect with him. Given his social standing, the laws of the time (set in the (not so?) distant future where Britain and Japan control the whole world), the status of his &#34;pet&#34;, and his innate interest in bondage, humiliation, and sadism, you can really see why he acts and thinks as he does. Every delightfully wicked thought made perfect sense to me, no matter how twisted or disgusted I felt regarding said thought personally.<br /><br />What I also loved was that the heroine, his pet, barely said more than fifty words in this whole piece, but she was, to me, a wonderfully developed and interesting character in her own right. I look forward to seeing her role expanded upon in the follow-up book.<br /><br />Speaking of which... Although the book is very sexual, there is an underlying plot that, once it gets going, you can't turn away from. For a while, I found things a bit repetitive: go to London, intense sex scene, go to London, another intense sex scene. But when the subplot started to surface, when the politics between the Lord and his wife arose, well... I couldn't read it fast enough. Never mind that the sex scenes, while explicit and frequent, were varied enough to keep my attention, but the rest of the story... Well, that made my heart race too.<br /><br />Some warnings. This is extremely explicit. There is dubious consent in play. Detailed bondage scenes. I don't think this is for the faint of heart, and readers unfamiliar with darker works should heed the warning and go in with their eyes open. There is also a major, major cliffhanger. That being said, I am pleased that this story will (hopefully) be told in two parts. Yes, it can be frustrating to have a book broken up into smaller pieces, BUT I think Litton has provided enough of a read here that the novella is satisfying in its length.<br /><br />Definitely a recommended read for those who can stomach the darker side of things. For me, this stands as erotica, not necessarily a romance, but things might change in Part Two. Can't wait!<br /><br />I voluntarily (and happily) reviewed this work after receiving an ARC.", "images": [], "asin": "B073B7BQW1", "parent_asin": "B073B7BQW1", "user_id": "AEPGU2NU53NJSXF4Y3C2LODSGEUQ", "timestamp": 1499880664948, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

As soon as State Department employee, Jaq Quartermane, is told of the tragic death of her fianc\u00e9 in Ethiopia she is dragged into a terrifying investigation rooted in the tales of the Knight Templars and the voyages of the explorers sponsored by Prince Henry the Navigator.<br /><br />Finding herself in peril inside an ancient rock hewn Ethiopian church, does she trust to her deep Christian faith or to Elymas, an agnostic rascal?  And it is trust and conspiracy which underline this thrilling adventure, taking Jaq from Rome to France, Portugal and Israel.<br /><br />While Jaq and Elymas try to solve the SATOR square, an ancient palindrome, their travels are paralleled by the story of three young 15th century Portuguese boys.  Meeting in alarming circumstances, Pero, Zarco and Dias form a bond which carries them through their difficult training at the Tomar observatory and sustains them in their navigational test at Prince Henry\u2019s fort in Sagres.  Split apart by the different missions they are given, their friendship is maintained and their actions will have repercussions throughout history.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the details of early exploration, which has always interested me, and the further involvement of Christopher Columbus add to the intrigue.

Neither one of them has forgotten the night they spent together, or the way that Blake blew Rebecca off. He's been carrying around a ton of guilt over how he ghosted her, always thinking of Rebecca as the one that got away. And Rebecca has been so emotionally damaged by that night that she hasn't let herself get close to another guy since Blake. But when fate offers them a second chance, will Blake be able to convince Rebecca to give him a fair shot?<br /><br />I liked how this story unfolded. Rebecca was hesitant to get involved with Blake again, and her indecision really came through as she struggled in trusting him again. And then when it came back to bite her in the butt, she knew her instincts had been right.

I get that he was a nerdy 16 year old and she was a popular cheerleader... but the twist in the scenario made it all make more sense.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this second-chance contemporary romance.

Overall, I can say that I like almost everything about the book. The worldbuilding is interesting, as is the main conflict. However, Jashi is frustrating and tries my patience A LOT, so often, I find myself muttering at her to shut up or that she's being stupid, which can make one wonder how I could continue the story. Admittedly, if the other aspects of the book weren't enjoyable, I wouldn't have. So, I guess that says something...? Really, her only benefit is her genealogy. Nothing else about her is made much of except negative things. She's short-tempered, ignorant, not very bright, disrespectful, illogical, etc. Furthermore, to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the thing that draws Jashi into doing something bad, that whole angle, in fact, doesn't make sense to me. It just seems like conflict for conflict's sake because it's not executed well.<br /><br />Still, it's an easy read that is otherwise quite interesting! I'm particularly interested in the history, the world, the dragons, and the male lead. Honestly, Jashi is the weak point of the novel. So I appreciate when it switches to him. Don't get me wrong!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A return to form", "text": "Warning--There are a few spoilers.<br /><br />I was kinda nervous to crack this book open, not gonna lie. I was so disappointed in First Star and didn\u2019t want to see more of the same. (Oh my god, was that really four years ago already? Holy cow.) But fear not! This felt like classic Phillips, and I adored it.<br /><br />There wasn\u2019t a whole lot I didn\u2019t like. Only a couple things come to mind\u2014the beginning was a bit slow and there wasn\u2019t much of a hook to pull you in. Also, the whole dancing thing should have been nixed. It served no purpose except to illustrate that at the beginning, Tess danced because she was sad, then at the end, she danced because she was happy. There was zero dancing in between and dancing didn\u2019t matter to any of the characters via career or hobby or fond memory or anything, it was just a useless and irrelevant plot device to tie in the title.<br /><br />I not only liked the characters, I respected them and sympathized with their complicated, well-realized emotional struggles; I bawled hard and ugly when Tess had to give Wren up. I loved all the secondaries, too: the Winchesters, the teenagers\u2014Psycho had two seconds of screen time, yet he oozed charisma and I still want to know more about him\u2014the Phishes, the Dennings, and Eli\u2019s family. Somehow, Eli was my favorite. He wasn\u2019t around much, but I found myself very concerned for him, and I just wanted to wrap him in my arms, give him some bacon, and tell him he\u2019s a good kid, doing a good job, and he\u2019s loved.<br /><br />I respected Phillips tackling a sticky, uncomfortable subject like teenage sex. I suppose some might feel it was too much like an agenda, too PSA-y, but that possibility didn\u2019t occur to me until just now, because I was so wrapped up in the well-developed, three-dimensional characters that it didn\u2019t feel like there was an ulterior motive, it just felt real.<br /><br />I appreciated the setting, which was very familiar and relatable to me. I live on a rural acreage fifty miles from the nearest hospital, just like the characters, and while I\u2019m lucky that the nearest town has an emergency response crew, if it didn\u2019t exist, the nearest would be at least 15 miles away, just like in the story. I understand the small-town, traditionalist mindset, the intimacy, the ignorance, and the survivalists. If my dad, bless his heart, were fitter and liked his creature comforts less, he might have become a survivalist, holed up in a bunker with his guns and conspiracies.<br /><br />I also appreciated all the research Phillips must have done to get all of the medical information correct. Well, I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s all correct, but I\u2019d place a huge bet on it being as accurate as it could be. She gave enough detail for it to feel authentic; in no way was there so much that it felt like she was showing off how much work she put into her research. It just felt knowledgeable, realistic, intelligent, and responsible.<br /><br />If I had to dig real deep for flaws, I would mention\u2014what was her name? Heather Cooper or something like that. The wannabe Instagram queen. I don\u2019t think she was fleshed out well; I still don\u2019t understand why she was so cruel to Tess. Was it really just that her ex-boyfriend asked Tess out after he and Heather broke up? What was the point of that? She either should have been given a stronger and more relevant motivation or been cut.<br /><br />But overall, I liked this book a lot. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll become a favorite that I regularly reread, like Breathing Room, Ain\u2019t She Sweet, and Heroes Are My Weakness, but it\u2019s not far behind.<br /><br />I don\u2019t know much about what\u2019s next for Phillips, but I did read somewhere a little while back, probably on her Facebook page, that she started working on the next book right away, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait four years again. I would guess the normal two, or if we\u2019re super lucky, perhaps one. *crosses fingers* Here's to hoping that book is equally good, if not better.<br /><br />noapologybookreviews.com<br />keeneyeediting.com", "images": [], "asin": "B07XPD48W2", "parent_asin": "B07XPD48W2", "user_id": "AG6CEYYUIU4RPVJ2CBBL4LW4C3VQ", "timestamp": 1591831520124, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "It will definitely get you thinking ...", "text": "Ord's book is a good overview of the severe problems that humanity faces today.  Ord's focus is on \"existential\" risk, defined as the risk of extinction or permanent collapse of civilization, downplays some serious merely catastrophic risks.  For example, Ord argues that nuclear war and climate change, while catastrophic, are likely not existential risks.  I agree with Ord that assigning probabilities is a necessary quantitative exercise, even though it is understood that some are rather subjective.  To do that, you need to have a concise standard to define probabilistic event - and perhaps \"existential\" is as good as any even.  \"Catastrophic\" will mean different things to different people, so it wouldn't be a useful standard for Ord's exercise.<br /><br />That said, I believe his treatment of climate change understates that issue.  For example, disruption of ocean circulation will have dramatic weather and climate impacts globally, not just some cooling in the North Atlantic as Ord supposes.  Still, I agree that whether climate change is an existential risk (over the next 3-5 centuries) or merely catastrophic is a debatable issue.  None of that diminishes the urgent need to deal with climate change, as I'm certain Ord would agree.<br /><br />Engineered pandemic - that's nothing short of damned scary!<br /><br />He did get me thinking about unaligned AI.  Unaligned AI is perhaps the most difficult of the risk to quantify because expert opinions are divergent.  Estimates of the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), range from 10 to 50 years, and even never.  Nonetheless, people need to be thinking a lot more about the risks of AGI, and how AI will be impacting our society in general.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Cookbook/Highly Recommended", "text": "So, I was offered this Kindle book at a discount for my unbiased opinion.  I have to begin with my initial reaction which was:  &#34;Great...another diet cookbook...yawn.&#34;  I was pleasantly surprised with this edition, however.  The book is broken down into two parts.  The first being a discussion about low-carb dieting and its benefits to both your metabolism and immune system.  There is narrative with respect to the effects of losing weight and discussion dispelling some old diet myths and what we've always been taught about low-carb/low-cal eating.  I was floored when I read that the average adult woman should only eat no more than 100 calories of sugar a day.  That is only 6 teaspoons and as we know, sugar is hidden in everything now.  The day I finished reading the book I prepared the Spinach Salad with Chicken and Raspberry for lunch and my husband and I loved the fresh, tangy take on the old spinach salad.  Tomorrow night's menu will include the Grilled Summer Kabobs which also look delicious.  I'm also ready to move on to the Pina Colada Smoothie and the Luscious Lime Cheesecake Tarts as well as the many Chinese recipes contained in this section of the book.<br /><br />The second portion of the book deals with a Comfort Food Diet Plan.  The best part of this section (after the recipes, of course) was the discourse at the end of the recipe portion outlining the fact that these recipes were designed with taste in mind.  It further goes on to make the reader understand that &#34;you do not need to eat foods you do not enjoy just to stay healthy.&#34;  Isn't it time the diet industry finally came out with a sensible plan that teaches us to eat what we like while staying healthy?  That is akin to having your cake and eating it too, isn't it? Since I had this morning off, I stayed home and tried the &#34;Quick and Easy Sour Pancakes&#34; for breakfast this morning.  The recipe uses milk and vinegar to mimic the flavor of sour cream and the result was delicious.  The Comfort Food section of the book contains a recipe for meat loaf and I have long been searching for a new meatloaf recipe.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing", "text": "I was so grateful and excited to read this book because I honestly can't get enough of MC romance! Sadly, as soon as I started reading the feeling that this book wouldn't meet my expectation weighed heavily upon me, but I pushed through it because the feeling felt premature. My instincts were right, something was definitely off about this book and it rested solely in the heroine's character, Arianne.<br /><br />In those first three chapters I enjoyed Jagger and Arianne's back and forth banter until their banter became more of a nuisance than entertaining conversation. It stopped being entertaining when Arianne continued to demean Jagger's love for her. He might not have said the words but the emotion was in ever action he dealt towards her. She was petty and loyal to a fault, and the fault usually resulted in others besides those she was loyal to to get hurt.<br /><br />Jagger's feelings towards Arianne progressed naturally, but Arianne drove me up a wall with her constant need to take what Jagger offered and still be all about herself. She cried and fought to be treated one way, but showed, to me at least, that she didn't really know what she wanted. She was constantly blind to the fact that Jagger was giving her everything she was boo hooing about wanting out of life outside of the biker world, which showed her immaturity. Jagger deserved someone better than her, someone who wouldn't meet him in the same level of toughness but also in the strength of character. Their chemistry throughout the first couple of chapters was there and then it just fell off a cliff and died, even their sex scenes were bland to me.<br /><br />Dawn became the character in this book that kept me reading, she was competent and loyal, two characteristics I need in a lead female character. She absolutely stole the show.

This focused on rugby for the sport, which was a happy surprise; although we only really saw one match, and it wasn't that detailed.<br /><br />Kip was a little crass, and definitely hairy (he calls himself a hairy godmother after all), but I just loved his character! He was used a lot, so he was super cautious especially at the beginning of the book. Teddy was adorable, and I felt like we could be best friends. The connection between these two was great; I liked how they started out with a weird friendship/partnership.<br /><br />I found myself laughing several times while reading this, so I'd say it was a romantic comedy. We don't meet that many people in this book besides the main characters, so we were pretty much focused solely on them. We met some of Teddy's friends, some of the jocks were mentioned, and Kip texted his sister a few times.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Last Knight", "text": "I really like the series so far.<br /><br />In this instalment, Conner finds himself in prison in Taran. Their prison though is basically the Colosseum of old with gladiators fighting with other gladiators from the other quarters of the Colosseum.<br /><br />The Knight fighting style is very reminicant of idea of Medieval Knight which base their techniques on brute strength. (Medieval Knights didn't really fight this way)<br /><br />The style that the Sak'Hurai has feels very similar to the Samurai (the art that I am most familiar with). Just just with two katanas instead on one.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that the Taran empire, who is the richest nation known in this universe, Centurions have the worst fighting skillset when they could spent a lot of money on the art of war. They also have been at war the longest in this universe. More than two hundred years. I would have thought that in that situation they would have mastered the art of fighting and warfare must more than any other nation. Especially with the competition between the East and West companies. The Taran empire feels very Roman.<br /><br />Deceiver = Devil<br />One god = God<br /><br />Very fimiliar concepts there.<br /><br />I also felt the pacing to be a bit off for my liking, but that might just be me.", "images": [], "asin": "B0178YXS90", "parent_asin": "B0178YXS90", "user_id": "AGCF7BIHMLJ3ROR7S23XVPXN7ASQ", "timestamp": 1447391690000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "While Jonquils for Jax is echantingly sweet, Marry Me Mad is delectably hot!", "text": "I loved Jonquils for Jax.<br />I really liked Marry Me Mad!<br />Both books are part of The Rousseau Series but both can be read as standalone. These two books are beautiful in different kind of way that readers will surely enjoy. While Jonquils for Jax is enchantingly sweet, Marry Me Mad is delictably hot. Forget the sweetness of Jonquils for Jax for a while because this book is more spice than sweetness and Katy delivered them well. And oh my gosh. CORT. The banters between him and Mad brought a lot of smiles on my face. I was surprised most of the times because I kinda found myself smiling more times than I can count. And if you want a sexy read with humor and wit, you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the harp scene. You got to read the book to find out. It's one of the hottest scene I've ever read in a romance books. Katy leveled up the hotness and I bet most of the readers will love it!<br /><br />In Marry Me Mad, I instantly fell in love with Cort. Knowing he's an Ambler who are known to be the blacksheep of the Blueberry Lane, added more allure to the personality of this thoughtful, beautiful, and talented soul. Here is a tattooed man who plays piano and harp and has the kindest and the softest of hearts.<br /><br />Madeleine Rousseau or Mad for short, is Jax's twin sister. If you already read Jonquils for Jax, then you know that Jax is the sassy one, the socialite twin, the popular award winning producer in Hollywood and the opposite of Mad. Mad is a librarian, the gentle, sweet and pristine Rousseau sister. But underneath her proper clothes and elegant pearls is a wild woman waiting to be unleashed.<br /><br />I had a glimpse of Mad and Cort in Jonquils for Jax but I didn't see the real Mad until this book. I know she was the sweet sister... the one who always there for you when you need someone to talk to. She's the listener who lives in the shadow of Jax, but deep inside she has sass and spice which made Cort love her more.<br /><br />I think that one of the highlights for me while reading this book is when I realized that many of us can actually relate to Mad. There is always something inside of us, no matter what our exteriors show to everyone else, that is hidden and waiting to be free. I kinda envy Mad for having Cort--passionate and loving and who knows the real her, appreciate her and embrace her wholly. I fall for Cort as well, more and more throughout the story.<br /><br />Marry Me Mad is like a second chance kind of book for me since Cort and Mad have loved each other since they were little but never had their chance until they meet after ten years or so. It is a story about two soulmates who are destined to love each other, but they needed time to grow separately and learn how to fight for true love and their happiness. It shows that some childhood feelings that is kept hidden through the years, when watered, sometimes makes the best kind of love. It can be a beautiful fairytale. Mad and Cort have that kind of fairytale.<br /><br />Though I still love Jonquils for Jax better than Marry Me Mad, this book is all love. For a girl who is a sucker for Happily-Ever-After, Katy Regnery's books is always a go to. I think this is her forte. She always give beautiful endings. It's like a sweet escape from all the ugliness in life and it makes you believe that fairytales can still do happen.<br /><br />Will I recommend this book? YES. Will I still read the next story? So freaking YES. Now, I am looking forward to J.C.'s story!", "images": [], "asin": "B01IV0GEK0", "parent_asin": "B01IV0GEK0", "user_id": "AFWB3RP5RB66ICPFTUZNXZGJJJLA", "timestamp": 1477038660000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

He tells her he's there on business with the FBI and needs her help finding out who the baby's mother is but three armed men come in to get the baby. Macy is pulled into the mystery and Tanner has been put in charge of keeping her and baby Addie safe until they can figure out what's going on. Why do people want the baby? How is Macy connected to the baby's family?<br /><br />The action kicked up quickly and I was anxious to figure out how the bad guys were tracking Addie and how the mom knew Macy. I was engaged in the story and couldn't put the book down. I read it in about five hours. I also enjoyed learning the backstory between Macy and Tanner and seeing how they interacted in such close proximity while navigating their reintroduction into one another's lives.

This is the first book I've ever read by Richard Amos, and I will admit, it depends on the way a dark urban style book is written, because I don't read a lot of them. I expect them to be action-packed, suspenseful, thrilling, and a rollercoaster I can't persuade myself to get off of. This novel was all of that wrapped up in a paranormal setting, which is one of my favorite genres to read. Jake just couldn't catch a break, losing his husband in a brutal way, following the killer, only to discover a whole new world he never knew existed. If that wasn't enough, the fate of the world rests on his shoulders. Any one of those scenarios would break someone, but all of that combined? I can't even imagine.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A nice introduction to the characters and series", "text": "The Governess Gambit was an excellent start to the The Wild Wynchesters series that wonderfully sets up the characters and the events to come.<br /><br />Chloe Wynchester and five other orphans were adopted as children by a wealthy baron with a noble purpose. Using his status in life, Baron Vanderbean works to right wrongs and fight for justice. Each of the Wynchesters has their own unique talents to aid in this quest. When the family learns of a unscrupulous headmistress exploiting orphans, the group put their skills to use to rescue the children.<br /><br />Each of the Wynchesters is unique in their own way with skills that most would consider unusual. This novella, as well as the first full-length book, focuses on Chloe who has an uncanny ability to go unnoticed. Her ability to move about sight unseen allows her to infiltrate places forbidden to her. It's definitely a skill that comes in handy throughout this story. Chloe is a fascinating character and I'm looking forward to learning more about her in the next book. I really enjoyed the dynamic between the siblings, it's clear they all care for one another and they've developed a great routine for their work.<br /><br />The primary focus of this novella is the Wynchesters working to discredit a school headmistress who is forcing orphans to work under the guise of giving them an education. I enjoyed watching the Wynchesters work and getting to see them show off their unique talents. The school storyline was quite interesting and I liked the way it wrapped up. A side plot in this novella is the theft of a painting belonging to the Wynchesters by a duke and the family's subsequent attempts to get the painting back from the man's son after he passes away. The painting storyline is unresolved in this novella as it is the primary focus of the first full-length book, The Duke Heist.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed The Governess Gambit and I'm looking forward to reading The Duke Heist soon.

But I'm so glad I made the jump (Har har. See what I did there?) because JUMP WHEN READY was an engaging, poignant book that stayed with me long after I read the last word.<br /><br />Henry is a great character with a consistent, realistic teenage voice. At first I had a little trouble keeping his new friends straight, but soon enough their personalities emerged and I loved the interaction between them. The idea of a group of friends from different decades, with different experiences and frames of reference, is really cool, and worked well within the world David created.<br /><br />The story of Henry's sister's abduction is intense and heart-wrenching. David kept me guessing as to how it would all play out, and I felt Henry's desperation and fear for Bethany right along with him. All of the characters in this book were really well developed, and that included the \"bad guys\" who kidnapped Bethany as well.<br /><br />There are difficult topics addressed in this book - suicide, abduction, and the obvious - death - and I think all are handled with sensitivity and respect. Despite the serious themes, the story stays surprisingly upbeat, with an incredibly poignant ending that had me in tears (the good kind!). Seriously. The ending made this book for me. All the pieces were engaging and kept me reading, but the way David tied everything up made me want to go back to the beginning and read it all over again, just to appreciate how it all comes together. When I came to the end, I was happy to have had the experience of following Henry's story and touched by the time I spent in David's world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.", "images": [], "asin": "B00C7F3SAK", "parent_asin": "B00C7F3SAK", "user_id": "AHU77COVCQKUA3LF4JAUAHQPBCTA", "timestamp": 1370524791000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Oh my stars!!", "text": "Independent Reviewer for Archaeolibrarian - I Dig Good Books!<br /><br />I love, love, love the \u201cahha\u201d moment in a story when the title makes sense. The ahha moment in this book is so,so, so good but so sad at the same time. It\u2019s a mixed bowl of emotions and I would honestly expect nothing less from our sweet, sweet India!<br /><br />If you\u2019ve read any other book by India, you\u2019ll know she doesn\u2019t stick to just one genre of books. She has branched out to a few different genre\u2019s and I think she has written them all equally well. What I really absolutely enjoy is that I have been reading her books nearly back to back and have yet to get sick of her writing style or the stories that she writes. I\u2019ve gone through phases where I would read one author\u2019s books back to back and by the third to fourth book in I was struggling and finding it hard to make myself read the story. I\u2019ve not experienced this yet with India\u2019s writing and this book makes the fourth book of hers that I\u2019ve read. I think this says a lot about her writing style and the ability to write in a couple of different genres. The story lines are different but the detail is also vastly different from one another. It\u2019s kind of like taking a deep breath and starting a new project.<br /><br />This story is intense. It\u2019s deep, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s pretty heavy. It\u2019s full of detail, descriptions, and emotions. There is a lot going on at times so I feel that concentration into the story is a must, or you might get off track. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and those characters are mentioned quite often so it\u2019s important to keep track of them all.<br /><br />It\u2019s very apparent that this story, book 1, is simply setting the stage for future books. It maps out the scenery, introduces the cast, both good and evil, and introduces us to a truly interesting story. It kind of feels like it could be a fairytale of sorts. It ends semi-abruptly and personally, I might have a little frustration towards the author for the way that she ended it.  That\u2019s simply because I wanted more. I needed more. I was hooked and I\u2019m just kind of hanging. Now, had she continued writing the story so it could be all in one book, it would be a massive book. I appreciate where she left off but I\u2019m silently begging for the next book.<br /><br />One last thing that I feel needs mentioning was the way she wrote one particular part of the story. It was referencing the Elves\u2019 and their ability to help one another, without expecting more, without frustration, and with joy. They didn\u2019t need to ask for help, their fellow friends were there, with their hands out, willing to help. It was automatic and without disdain. It was so opposite of what we experience today. It caused me to pause, think of my actions, my friends\u2019 actions, my co-worker\u2019s actions. It made me think of how I am raising my children. It simply just made me pause and think.  It was such an important message that I hope others were able to grasp its importance as much as I did.<br /><br />I\u2019d absolutely recommend this story. I feel like I\u2019m leaving out some other major details that made this story just absolutely knock my socks off, but I hope I gave you enough information to make you want to go read this book, now. It was such a good read, I can\u2019t wait for book two.<br /><br />* A copy of this book was provided to me with no requirements for a review.

A player is called for \"Unnecessary roughness\". No such penalty exists in hockey. Football yes, Hockey no. It's just \"roughing\". The other thing was Gage going for X Rays after his shoulder injury. X Rays would tell his medical staff absolutely nothing other than he had no broken bones. Gage would need an MRI to see anything- including any kind of bruising.

At first, I wasn't quite sure if I would like Samantha. I didn't want the character to play the role as a brat. I didn't want them to be immature while seeking the attention of an older gentleman. Thankfully, Samantha wasn't like that at all. She was such an old soul. She had to grow quickly and wasn't sure who to trust. I felt like Samantha wanted to place that trust in the hands of her guardian. But she was so scared... Samantha was scared of being abandoned. I feel like all of us has felt abandoned a time or two. Maybe alone...<br /><br />Liam... I loved his character from the get go. He was man of precision and control. He barely let down his guard. I felt like he wanted to for Samantha but he didn't know how to it. Liam was all about protecting Samantha from dangerous places and/or people. He wanted her from himself, which made me so sad.

Derrick Houston, immediately attracted to Molly,  hires them as ranch hands for the ranch he and his brother Caleb  run.  This is where the premise becomes weird.

Caleb shares Derrick's attraction to her, but is more hesitant about her willingness to live on the ranch. After both brothers share some sexual moments with Molly, they decide to &#34;test&#34; her by not completing the sexual act.  Molly is insecure about her place with the brothers, and is ready to leave before they finally wake up and realize they are about to lose her.  At least they then apologize and tell her how much she means to them.<br /><br />I found Derrick weak and Caleb infuriating.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Mixed feelings. (contains spoilers)", "text": "My overall impression is to give a good 4 or 5 stars because I found the plot very engaging. Whether certain scenarios were predictable or not I found myself wondering what would happen next because it was written differently enough from canon to be intriguing. And there was no great emphasis on peripheral characters. There were no long tangents rhapsodizing on Jane and Bingley's wretched plight or on Caroline's or Collins' machinations. It was all ODC for the most part (even when Wickham and Georgiana were discussed).<br /><br />However, there is one MAJOR fly in the ointment: the book is simply over-narrated. There is so much repetitive, long-winded explanation of events and introspection by Darcy and Elizabeth that they barely speak to each other. Their dialogue alone I would wager comprises 15% of the book or less. The amount of times that the two \"open their mouths to speak\" then fail to do so is utterly maddening. This left very little opportunity to develop any kind of fulfilling understanding. I rolled with it for about half the book, then I started to get irritated because I knew where it was inevitably headed. Small matters and details were drawn out and expounded upon in repetitive fashion, and, alas, the most important matter, the crux of the plot was hurriedly laid out in one or two pages at the VERY end then BOOM--epilogue.<br /><br />After reading the final chapters I felt like deducting several stars based on the conclusion alone. The consummation of the marriage is built up as the major plot point throughout but inexplicably we are left to completely imagine it in the end. And when it comes to the hard fought for declaration of feelings we find that on one side they have been overheard rather than conveyed directly. They're almost stated as a foregone conclusion rather than a shocking revelation. That makes little sense given how devoted both were to the idea that the other could never love them. Very disappointing culmination of what was a decent read.", "images": [], "asin": "B01LZ2PO1J", "parent_asin": "B01LZ2PO1J", "user_id": "AEBAC6XPTYZRNBKDVW3MI5Y5HYAQ", "timestamp": 1583809864606, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "5 BEAUTIFUL LANDON STARS", "text": "BOOK REVIEW by Michelle 20th MAY 2013:<br /><br />RATING: 5 BEAUTIFUL LANDON STARS<br /><br />After falling for Oscar Maree in Hale Maree, I wondered how Misty was going to write Landon. Oscar is a beautiful , phwoaaaarrr!! smexi lad whose persistence won Hale over, not to mention his...........<br /><br />Misty wrote a most gorgeous voice in Landon. The lad is this mix of humour, thinks outside the box, not afraid to accept responsibility.... and can he make your toes curl.<br /><br />I uber uber uber loved this book!<br /><br />I laughed so much. Misty has this magnificent witty talent. I connected with Landon in Hale Maree, I knew I wanted to read his book and I knew I wanted him to hook up with Sher.<br /><br />Sher is this loveable, total giggle pot. She has a most unique voice for a character. I loved hearing Landon's inner monologue about Sher and her giggling.<br /><br />I loved her giggling.<br /><br />I could hear her giggles.... especially the chainsaw ones.<br /><br />LOL!<br /><br />\"We're going hobbit hunting,\" Sher giggles, but it doesn't derail Saul in the least.<br /><br />How've you been?\" I inquire lightly annnd...she giggles. Damn. It's like a bucket of ice in my shorts.<br /><br />I just came off of a quickie relationship with Amy-the-Psychopath, and now I've landed the Giggler, who might actually end up going Jack the Ripper on me.<br /><br />A serious topic is the basis for Misty's story about Landon and Sher and she handles it brilliantly.<br /><br />I have not laughed so much one minute and then had my toes curl the next in a book.<br /><br />I tug her earlobe into my mouth, or maybe it's her lip... I don't have a clue. It's just soft and warm and makes me think of nipples.<br /><br />\"That's fine,\" I tell her. \"But if you happen to be the one that gets thirsty first, I just want you to know, I'm not stingy with my milk at all.\"<br /><br />She reaches across me, brushing over my crotch, and the alarm in my jean-submarine instantly flashes: Semen! All hands on deck!<br /><br />OMG!<br /><br />I have some favourite scenes.<br /><br />*waggles eyebrows *<br /><br />Misty put the sizzle in Landon and Sher.<br /><br />Misty really does have writing talent. She drew me in from the first page. I connected with Landon, and his inner monologue is brilliant fun and how he sees Sher and how he wants to give her what she thinks she will miss. He really is a stand up guy. He is honest with himself and with Sher with regards to the situation and that is all you can do.<br /><br />I really love a guy like Landon. There is just something special about the way they see life and what it throws at them and how they handle it. He has such a talent for being creative in his endeavors to try to stop Sher making a big mistake in his eyes.<br /><br />I loved how much he cares.<br /><br />Give Sher a reason, give her a life. The things she wants to do though - horse riding, pole dancing, tattoos, sex with strangers - I'm not sure how okay I am with letting her have four whole episodes of `Sherr Gone Wild'. I'm sure as hell not going out to recruit a dude to do her on the beach.<br /><br />A very clever story that even had me getting a bit teary.<br /><br />Landon knows how to bring romance to the picnic ... his style of picnic. To have a guy in your life like Landon who truly puts the thinking cap on to make a girl feel special is something to see.<br /><br />\"You can stop trying to be my hero,\" she says. \"I don't need one.\"<br /><br />\"But I do,\" I tell her, \"and this was the address they gave me.\"<br /><br />Horses, pole dancing, tattoos, stranger sex on the beach. I try to keep my lip from hanging open.<br /><br />\"Okay,\" I rub my hands together slowly. \"I really didn't see three of those things coming.\"<br /><br />The sub characters are very entertaining. I loved Sher's interesting family. Her mother Lisa,  is quite a character that you can't help but like and her oompa loompa sized brothers and sisters are like rugrats on Red Bull.<br /><br />Sher showed her ability to be a great mother and role model when the rugrats joined in the story.<br /><br />I loved having Oscar pop up with Hale. They are such great characters and I just loved hearing Oscar's voice again.<br /><br />I can see why Oscar and Landon are such good friends. They both won't let the girl in their life run away without a fight. They love hard.<br />I totally dig that you don't have to read Hale Maree first to read Landon and Sher's story, but I highly recommend that you read Hale Maree first , so you can meet Oscar and get your glimpse of Landon. He will make you want to read more.<br /><br />This was a story that the doctor ordered. I needed a book to have something different in a contemporary.<br /><br />This is a funny, witty, heart warming read with some theft and major giggle fits. Landon will show you why he can fall for a chainsaw giggler and you will be rooting for him to win Sher over.<br />Misty delivers in true Misty style.<br /><br />Michelle", "images": [], "asin": "B00CFA85TQ", "parent_asin": "B00CFA85TQ", "user_id": "AHPYJKGDBY2JEJ3CDBAXXHIDLBTQ", "timestamp": 1369049436000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Strong psychological thriller", "text": "A dead woman is brought onto the beach by the sea and found by a little girl and her mother.<br />Miles from there, happily married Carmen and Tom live in the city. What is the link?<br /><br />No need to grill me, I admit this book is a cover choice. That blue is mesmerizing. Now that I think of it, I could have picked it for Halloween, and not just because of the cover. If some of us find happiness in magic worlds or intergalactic wars, I get all the feelings from psychological thrillers. I ain\u2019t scared of monsters! Except when they look and sound like your husband.<br /><br />Carmen is finally happy. She almost has it all. A nice apartment in London, a handsome and caring husband, and step kids to take care of on weekends. Yes, she was made redundant because of the economic crisis but free time is a good thing, right? Well, it depends on what you do with all those hours.<br /><br />The perfect blended family and couple bliss image take a hit when a remark by a strange about a murder makes Carmen think about her husband Tom\u2019s past. It all happens quite early in the book, and from that moment on, I could not put it down. Tom had confessed it all to Carmen a long time ago. How his marriage had ended, how he had met Her, younger, beautiful, how he used to take her to St Jude\u2019s just like they did now with the kids, how she had gone missing and been found later, dead on the beach. But knowing about it does not mean you are not curious.<br /><br />For once, there is no big secret hovering over heads and fears of a happy bubble exploding. Many elements are in the open air, known to the main character, and when I thought it would only take the thrill away, I was proven wrong. How so wrong! Knowing a truth does not mean you know the whole truth, and this is what the book is about. How much do you say to make people believe you? How much do you keep hidden, stored away in a box? And why is the entire story better left unsaid? These are the questions I kept asking myself while devouring chapter after chapter. I was growing more curious with every page while Carmen was getting more puzzled with every hour.<br /><br />One remark, it is all it takes to create a doubt. Suddenly words turn into doubts, and your mind won\u2019t snap out of it. A word, a look, a question unanswered, and a woman\u2019s mind goes wild. One thing leading to another and before you realize it you are making every possible scenario in your head. From there goes the snowball effect. I am not saying we all are crazy paranoid beings ready to jump on our better halves at the first sign of something sketchy (says the girl who made a scene about a lipstick stain on a towel before noticing she was wearing the same shade of lipstick on her lips that same day\u2026 :p) But the right circumstances and a series of details can lead to something so much bigger than you could ever imagine.<br />The shady husband trope is my thing. Husbands make for the perfect suspect, and Tom is a brilliant lawyer, a loving father, and a wonderful character to doubt.<br /><br />I love that Carmen\u2019s suspicions are all based on substantial details, leaving the reader questioning her mindset and sanity. Is it okay to erase something from a computer? I do it every day, does that make me a killer? Is forgetting to mention something a lie? I warmed to Carmen very early on, when her life was all about what to eat and how to keep the kids busy, and it was very interesting to see the impact of the events on her decisions and actions. Every character is portrayed in a way that makes them real, sometimes relatable, sometimes despicable, but always real. Tom and the children are no simple secondary characters, and the family ties are strongly represented, giving the story a heavier tone. After all, all families are complicated!<br /><br />So many questions came in waves as I was scrabbling to reach the end. I doubted everything, and even though I managed to get a couple of answers before the end, the steady pace kept me on my toes and the race of the last pages left me breathless.<br /><br />Undertow is a strong psychological thriller using our deepest fears and playing with the \u2014sometimes blind \u2014 trust we put in others. It will make you think twice about what you think you know and keep you turning pages long after curfew!<br /><br />I received an advanced copy of this book.", "images": [], "asin": "B01CI72U1E", "parent_asin": "B01CI72U1E", "user_id": "AEYGIOBNABA3S7QB6KFJZRMDYMBQ", "timestamp": 1476181277000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Yes, we get it, you like King, but did you have to throw not one, but several scenes in there? Its forced and definitely served no purpose in one instance and the main occurrence literally made me roll my eyes. This seems to be a trend lately in the Indie world and the practice can\u2019t die soon enough.<br /><br />Men should never write about menstruation . Seriously, like never, ever.  I don\u2019t like that scene on Carrie because that would have NEVER happened yet now all male writers seem to think that\u2019s how it goes.<br /><br />Several parts of the story were... inconceivable. Like, grossly so. I don\u2019t want to spoil the story, but there was no way it happened the way it happened. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02<br /><br />I think with time and honest feedback, this author has potential.", "images": [], "asin": "B07PDW67C3", "parent_asin": "B07PDW67C3", "user_id": "AGX4C22RTAMGDKT4GH3A7PPJFVNA", "timestamp": 1585676233474, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}
