{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fun Escapist Fantasy with an Inventive Magic System", "text": "Blake Charlton has done the extraordinary with Spellright. He has managed to use all the tired tropes of classic Epic Fantasy (magical books, dragons, a school for wizards, and a boy who didn't fulfill his destiny) and make them all feel fresh and engaging. Plus he does it with a main character, Nicodemus Weal, who you can't help but to root for.<br /><br />The dragons, although they happen off screen, are quite inventive as are the various animated helpers that swarm the keeps and grounds of Starhaven, which is the school in question. Nicodemus is an apprentice spellwright also known as authors who suffers from a form of magical dyslexia known as Cacography, which is based off the authors own battles with it. Of course the story also involves prophecies about a special Wizard who could be a a great hope to the land or harbinger of the demons of the past who wish to control the world.<br /><br />There are a few bumps in the road, but most are forgivable in the name of fun escapist Fantasy. The pacing was a little stop and go, especially in the first third. The magic systems while also the strongest and most original part of the book are initially a bit confusing, but about 100 pages in a much clearer explanation is given. This could have come a tad sooner, but it probably would have slowed down the pacing of the story if it had. Also, at one point the main villain comes off a a little too much like a bad Bond nemesis by over explaining himself and the plot, which was on the excessive side. More than one soliloquy happens like this. This problem may stem from the author trying not to drag things out. Lastly, the fight at the end of the story was worth waiting for, but the very last section felt a little tacked on and Eragon-like. Still Charlton at least condensed a fairly long time frame in a short number of pages instead of stretching a training story into a whole other book as Paolini did.<br /><br />There are many different wizard factions each with their own view points and magics. The histories shared from each group were quite fascinating, although there is plenty left to reveal in future installments. Charlton has also sneaked in one of my favorite and criminally underused mythical constructs, which I'd love to mention but he went through pains to make it a big reveal. The style is heavily influenced by the likes traditional Epic Fantasy from Feist, Le Guin, and Tad Williams so don't go expecting some gritty, harsh Fantasy. Blake is being evocative of something more playful yet every bit as Epic as all the aforementioned names. A whole lot of foreshadowing goes on, which was expected given it is planned trilogy.<br /><br />Even though Spellwright is Charlton's debut it certainly doesn't show many freshman jitters, but he has left himself room to grow.  If you're a fan of classic style Epic Fantasy this will be a must for you.  I give Spellwright 8 out of 10 Hats. Spellwright is definitely in the running for debut of the year so far and it would be surprising if it wasn't still near the top by the end.  Now he's gotten me all in the mood to read some classic Robin Hobb.", "images": [], "asin": "0765317273", "parent_asin": "0765317273", "user_id": "AFK4RWKGQU6YZNVAJTFPQSC3QZPQ", "timestamp": 1267535898000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Holocaust-themed...with wisps of Don Quixote", "text": "It is not unusual to compare a Holocaust-themed book with other excellent fictional works from that time period. So it was interesting that the one book that sprung to mind after closing the pages of completing Blooms of Darkness was Cervantes' Don Quixote.<br /><br />The parallels between the two abound.  Don Quixote--in the traditions of knights-errant of old - finds a love whom he names Dulcinea...or \"sweetness.\"  She is not rich or famous or beautiful or well-born, but to him, she is his queen and his lady. She begins as someone with little self-worth but by the end, she blooms under Don Quixote's love.<br /><br />In Blooms of Darkness, the person who blooms is Mariana, who works in a brothel that services German occupiers.  She is entrusted with the care of Hugo - a pre-teen - by his mother, an old school friend, when the Jews are forced to go into hiding.<br /><br />Although the story is Hugo's, the spotlight often shines on Mariana, a contradiction of piousness and looseness, self-centerness and unselfishness.  Hidden in Mariana's closet - literally and figuratively - Hugo craves her attention and views her as his personal Dulcinea.  The majority of the novel is set within her bedroom...and in his imagination.<br /><br />Aharon Appelfeld - a 78-year-old Israeli writer - and his excellent translator Jeffrey M. Green - write the entire book in the present; the implication is that the present is the only time that exists, since the past and the future have been obliterated.  The tone is understated and controlled, taut and haunting.<br /><br />Gradually, he creates a grafting of his two key characters - Hugo and Mariana. As a mocking townswoman says: \"Whores and Jews are always persecuted. There's nothing to be done.\"  Indeed, as life spirals downward for both Hugo and Mariana - as the world looks on without pity and defines each of them as less than human - the two look to each other for sustenance and love.<br /><br />At times, as a reader, I hoped for a little less reticence; still, there was no time where I didn't admire and respect what Mr. Appelfeld was so intelligently creating. The universal themes of loss and loneliness are explored here, along with the optimism of the differences that one person can make in the life of another. While the story is grim and disturbing, it is, in curious ways, also uplifting.

It's been a long while since I've picked up a Harlequin series romance book, for several different reasons. Thankfully, I broke my cold spell and devoured Jo Leigh's NOT-SO-SECRET BABY in about four hours! I'd almost forgotten how good Intrigue books are, but believe me-I'll never forget again!<br /><br />Jenny Granger was a barely legal age cocktail waitress in Las Vegas when she fell under the spell of C. Randall Todd. A man who oozed charisma, charm, and wealth, Jenny allowed herself to be blinded by Todd and his bling-the money that had never seemed all that important while working her way through college suddenly bought her clothes, jewelry, and a limited peace of mind. Todd didn't push her into a romantic relationship; instead, Jenny willingly took the jump on her own, and by then, it was too late. Because Todd, once he had a grip on something or someone, wasn't a man to let go. By force, intimidation, and mental cruelty, he possessed a grip on Jenny that she couldn't shake-until, that is, she enlisted the aid of one of Todd's henchman, Nick Mason, and made her escape.<br /><br />Now her life is peaceful. She's a single mother with a young son, living in a quiet town where no one knows who she really is or where she came from. Life is the way Jenny wants it-until she wakes one night and discovers that her son, Patrick, is gone, and that Todd has found her hiding place. Now her innocent son is in the clutches of a man who makes Mafia mob bosses look tame by comparison, and Jenny has no choice but to return to Vegas and the ministrations of a man who wants only to make her pay.<br /><br />Nick Mason is still one of Todd's right-hand men, along with a real baddy named Henry Sweet. Todd is determined to rear his son, Patrick, in his own image as an ungodly-wealthy casino owner and arms dealer, and to make Jenny suffer for her betrayal. It's up to Nick to help Jenny avoid Todd and his sadistic temper, at the same time rescuing Patrick from a life of terror and intimidation. But with his own heart on the line, not to mention his top-secret reason for being in the employ of C. Randall Todd for these past three years, Nick is running out of time-and running out of reasons to avoid Jenny and the emotions she stirs up in him.<br /><br />Jo Leigh writes nail-biting romantic suspense with heart-pounding emotions and dialogue. Her characters in NOT-SO-SECRET BABY are all so real that you can't help being swept up in this world of love, danger, and passion that she's created.

You feel the emotions the characters  Ananda and Radesh feel, you can smell and taste the food they eat and the sights they see, and you want to swallow this event of a book as a whole, in one sitting.  Set in one day of the life of Margaret Thatcher's 1980s London, it follows the footfalls of the two main characters during a normal day.  This day is filled with reflections on their chosen paths, food, the environment and choices they have made in life.<br /><br />Normally this is not the kind of book I read at all.  I don't like normal fictional literature, I like urban fantasy, science fiction, classics, mommy porn, non-fiction and true accounts.  But just regular books that win awards and that other people like I normally don't get.  This book was so highly rated by another reviewer that I felt I had to get myself a copy.  Which I did promptly, and thank goodness for that because there were only a few left.  And it is a highly readable, sometimes witty, always provocative musing into cross cultural differences and the life of the 1980s.  The two main characters were opposites but both were likable. The book is more witty than laugh out loud funny-and one does need knowledge of a lot of cultural norms in the 1980s to get some of the humor.  As of 2/19/2015, this is the best written fictional book that I have read this year.  It is a quick read, and is good for a cold day, when you have some free time so you can look up things you don't understand (Amit is a very clever writer in his use of metaphors) or quite get the joke of.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great quick read.", "text": "This is a short yet comprehensive diary of Robert Fear's travels. There's lots of detail such as times arrived, temperatures etc. A brief, concise style, almost note-form in some places. You can really get a feel for where he is, he mentions the contrasts of the swish hotels with the poverty also occurring alongside. For me, even though it's short, there's so much info-great as I have never been any of these places. It's short and to the point-a great quick read. He tells about the transport, the food. It really is the perfect type of book for me-I can experience travelling there without actually going or slumming it in dodgy hostels! Some may not like the seemingly unnecessary details like the mentions of exactly what time he gets up or how long he has a lie-in, he waits for his hair to dry etc! But it's a good short read and gives you some idea what a trip on a budget could be like. He mentions the rich variety of things on offer at the street markets. There's also a bit of a nightmare going on such a trip: having to cope with toothache/possible abscess? I love books in Diary format-this is Fred's Diary of his trip from Feb 19th to March 18th. A one month trip. I'm surprised at the temperatures, somehow thought it would be hotter, even though it's Feb/March. I like how he says what he was reading at the time and about the foods he buys/eats. He has an offer of work. He does do this job-it's something you don't expect. There is a very interesting chapter about this. I'm interested in the tooth aspect as my sister is a dental nurse-I was hoping he didn't end up with an abscess a long way from home! Here is variety, good variety,some things I never thought of on his trip eg going to a Golf Tournament-I don't know why I wouldn't think of this-they play Golf in lots of countries. This book was just what I wanted at the time-a shorter read after reading some long ones, beta reading, looking hard for details etc so this was a relaxing, easy read. Some reviewers I've seen have marked it down as it's short but it does say the number of pages on the listing and when comparing like for like shorter books, I whizzed through this and enjoyed it so it's going to be a high star rating, simple as that. It makes interesting reading about the country's different ways. Shocking to us sometimes. He plans for his next trip and thinks how much flights etc will cost. There are some strange combinations for meals: Macaroni cheese with curry sauce and eggs-all on toast? Oh my goodness, what a laugh, what a meal! I like this travel writing, describing the features of the area. Crushed pineapple and cornflakes now! Now, there is a bit of an abrupt ending? We don't find out what happened to Rita? Perhaps there should be some sort of indication that it's going to be continued in next book? Obviously I know there's another book and I have it but some readers may not realise? It's a good tactic to 'leave them wanting more' though. A great little read. A great taster for what's to come in the next book and his longer, full length diary. I enjoyed it. I have just finished his follow up to this; Time In Thailand-this is another Diary and is a bit longer and this was even better.", "images": [], "asin": "B0094W4808", "parent_asin": "B0094W4808", "user_id": "AEMVLBKWX62W5E4B6AN2PPMI4FNQ", "timestamp": 1430848145000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good But Could Have Been Better", "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed \"Dead and Gone.\"  While I agree with the reviewer who said Sookie has changed, I also know that she has been through a lot.  She has seen more death and suffered more than many of us will in a lifetime.  She has gone from a virgin to a woman having had multiple relationships with vampires and a weretiger, not to mention the sexual tension with her shapeshifter boss.  She has also suffered so many physical injuries since she met Bill.  I fully expected that she would change along the way.<br /><br />I also have to admit that Charlaine Harris could have done a better job explaining the background of some of the supernatural events and the mythology that was going on.  And, some of the explanations, especially some of the names, and the entrances and exits of characters were confusing.  In addition, there is a scene (SPOILER) with Quinn that just didn't seem to make a lot of sense to me.  He seemed so great.  Is he really such a jerk?  Also, she talks about how she is a christain but not a good one.  She also tells one of the characters she is a christain but then the dialogue on that subject just stops.  I hope Charlaine Harris will explore that more in future books.<br /><br />However, I really enjoyed how Sookie and Eric finally got together. That was something I was personally hoping for.  I also enjoyed how Bill is still around and interested.  And, Sookie doesn't seem to mind that at all and (SPOILER) even acknowledges she knows that he still loves her.  Unlike one reviewer I read, I think the continuing tension with Bill being around is great.  Is he becoming a better guy?  Is he changing to try and get her back or does he just want to be in her life in some way?  I am looking forward to seeing how that turns out.<br /><br />One suggestion, if Charlaine Harris should read this, all of the local fans I know all love Pam.  I was also fascinated with the introduction of Hunter in the previous book.  I hope Pam and Hunter will play bigger roles in future books.  Pam is wonderful and Hunter is fascinating!<br /><br />Overall, despite any shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have read all of them in the series and will probably re-read all of them before \"A Touch of Dead\" comes out in October (what else do we have to do until then).  And, yes, I have already pre-ordered it!<br /><br />If you a Sookie fan, I think you will enjoy the book.", "images": [], "asin": "0441017150", "parent_asin": "0441017150", "user_id": "AFEYVPX5USAZWNED7W4LP4NY5XOA", "timestamp": 1241885245000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true}

This book seeks to redress that imbalance, putting the better-known musical work into context with the entire body of Orridge's considerable creative output.<br /><br />--Here, too, are discussions (and pictorial representations) of Orridge's pioneering explorations into body modification and transgenderism, commenced long before such issues became, if not commonplace, not entirely alien pursuits to civilized society suggestive of outright insanity.<br /><br />--Orridge shocked, offended, and influenced many during the heyday of Throbbing Gristle and confrontational performance art, and continues to do so, albeit in a far more behind-the-scenes fashion today.<br /><br />--Organized, in part, by Orridge, including a short essay and a couple of interviews, \"Painful but Fabulous\" is a record of an extraordinary personage who turned a personal life into a public artwork--and made no compromises. As a result, the art has great integrity and power, and has received little compensation and less regard.<br /><br />--Orridge stands as a kind of modern-day Artaud: a boundary-breaking artist who took art not only seriously, but as a sacred calling that required blood and sacrifice, and nothing less than one's entire life. Such artists are usually not well-rewarded in their own lifetimes, and sometimes not even after their lives are over. They remain too far outside the ability of the culture to commodify their efforts. Orridge is and may well always remain, in that regard, especially in the  magickal underpinning of his artistic output, an artist's artist.<br /><br />--A book for the primitive, but not the prude; for the cultured but not the polite, \"Painful but Fabulous\" records a life in art that was no doubt painful to live, but, when all is said and done, fabulous.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Contrast Between to Warriors", "text": "January 19, 2019<br />A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of the Book: Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two American Warriors by Stephen E. Ambrose<br /><br />I purchased this book in Kindle Format from Amazon in November 2018 and finally got a moment to read it. I have read other books by Stephen Ambrose but never reviewed them, and my readings were several years ago.  I knew this would be a superbly researched and well written book about a major event in American History.  I never fail to add to my knowledge of History, especially from a great author like Stephen Ambrose.<br /><br />I had, several years ago, read Custer  auto biographical work entitled my \u201clife on the Plains\u201d which gave me some good insight into Custer's character and consequently as an auto biography, it was not too revealing of his flaws but was a very good read.<br /><br />Ambrose is a master historian and this \u201cCrazy Horse and Custer\u201d work shows thorough research and gives glimpses into both the Native Indian's culture and philosophy of life and he even touched on something I was not aware of, namely that certain males were considered \u201cspecial\u201d  implicit was that they were effeminate and therefore not suited for being warriors but did play advisory roles as both medicine men and educators.<br /><br />Being a warrior was the essential way the young males showed their value to the tribe which it seems were always at war even way before the white man's arrival.  War for them was not \u201ctotal\u201d but enough to be able to claim a victory. A battle that resulted in more than a couple of casualties was rare before one side or the other was able to claim a win. Crazy Horse was a fierce warrior from his youth and would, many times over think strategies and hunting plans.  He was very much an introvert and a thinker, not a chief but a respected warrior.<br /><br />George Armstrong Custer, was a contemporary of Crazy Horse but became a warrior through education at West Point.  His appointment to West Point was an interesting story being his lineage was not one of<br />privilege or breeding.  He was naturally intelligent but manifested a concentrated effort to get in to West Point.  Once he was admitted he demonstrated a bit of a \u201cslacker\u201d effort and was always in disciplinary trouble but never to the point of expulsion, but too close for comfort.  His academic achievement were nothing to write home about and graduated at the bottom of his class.<br /><br />He graduated early as the Army was in need of officers for the Civil War.  In the Army, Custer was always affable, in spite of his being a Democrat which impacted on his Army career.  He was terribly ambitious and heroically motivated and resulted in several notorious reports about his Calvary accomplishments. He rose to the rank of Brevet Major General but after the War his permanent rank was Lieutenant Colonel.  He remained in the Army and was assigned to the Calvary in the Plains.<br /><br />His life paralleled Crazy Horses life but the contrast and differences between them was superbly laid out by Ambrose.  One easily concludes the differences and the fact tat these two warriors would meet in combat. They were destined to meet.  Both, however, were to die violent deaths at different points in time in conflicts with both their respective tribes.<br /><br />If you are attracted to historical events and people and a better understating of the conflicts between the Whites and Indians, I highly recommend reading this book.  I gave this book five (5) stars out of five.", "images": [], "asin": "B00KQZY19A", "parent_asin": "B00KQZY19A", "user_id": "AEAMJFN3RWLK4MEB5BKLMUCUKA2Q", "timestamp": 1550787681466, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

Now  thirty years later when Charlie is asked by his wife Rachel what he would like for his birthday, the answer he gives is that he would like to quit his job as a high school English teacher for six months so he can write a best selling horror novel. When she agrees they sell their home and find a cheap rental in Castle Rock. As he starts to write the first few chapters come easy, but then nothing,and he comes to realize that he can't possibly write about something he knows nothing about, so he decides to dabble in the supernatural for inspiration. His first foray into the supernatural is buying and using a Ouija board, which seems to work because the chapters are flowing again, but he is also experiencing some weird things in the house. When he confides in his wife about what he has been doing she jumps on board with him and soon she seems almost obsessed with the paranormal. It soon becomes a battle of spiritual warfare, and when Charlie's guardian angel shows up and allows him to see the demons that are wreaking havoc on his family, Charlie does the only thing he can do, he turns to God to save his family!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! While this book deals with the topic of paranomal and \"demons\" the author writes it in such a way that it isn't really scary, he actually weaves alot of  quirky humor into the story.I loved the footnotes peppered throughout the story and found myself reading them first thing when I found them on the page, and acutally had to laugh about the refrence to The Ghost Hunters on Sci-Fi, because its a show I watch regularly!<br />The thing that really jumped out at me throughout the story is just how easy it is to allow darkness into our lives,and once its there its not always so easy to get rid of.

She struggles and James is not helping with his advisement's.<br />Calliope has done something very bad. She has left an opening for the one being that could destroy the world. The only one that can help is the last person Kate wants to see in any world, Persephone. Things get worse, the danger thicker, life hangs in the balance. Kate's love for Henry might not be enough. Traveling through the Underworld we see many things so not very pretty.<br />I loved this tale, the emotions the intrigue had me up all night finishing the story. Oh, but tsk tsk  Ms. Carter, did it have to end that way ? I will be anxiously waiting for the next book !", "images": [], "asin": "0373210264", "parent_asin": "0373210264", "user_id": "AFA36NT24LBGA5IPMJSKP2GQ3KTQ", "timestamp": 1327094638000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Cuban Solzhenitsyn", "text": "Virtually everyone today agrees that the Soviet Union truly was an evil empire, but, strangely, many think that the Communist regime in Cuba is nowhere near as sinister as its Eastern European counterparts were.  A reading of \"Against All Hope\" will disabuse anyone of that na\u00efve notion.<br /><br />The author, Armando Valladares, was thrown into the Cuban gulag in 1960 for being suspected of being against Fidel Castro's Communist takeover, and suffered in prison for 22 long years before being released in 1982.<br /><br />Valladares recalls his brave attempt at escape in the early years of his captivity.  Unfortunately, that escape attempt failed, and the author was returned to prison to face some of the most inhuman conditions imaginable.  Reading the book is simply not for the faint of heart--the treatment he endured is about as close as one could come to being in hell on earth.  The descriptions of the food, sanitary conditions, and medical care (or lack thereof of these things) are almost beyond belief.<br /><br />One of the chief goals that the Communists had regarding their prisoners was \"Political Rehabilitation\"--forcing the prisoners to accept and support the Communist regime in return for being let out of jail.  The author describes the psychological warfare, the constant relocations to different prisons, the degrading treatment, and the withholding of medical care that the Communists used to attempt to get the prisoners to embrace Communism.  But Valladares also describes the profound psychological strength that he and others displayed in the face of the Communists' thuggish tactics--strength that ultimately resulted in the author being freed.<br /><br />At the time of Castro's Communist takeover against the Batista regime, Cuba had one of the highest standards of living in the Western Hemisphere, but after years of Communism, the nation devolved into a hellhole.  One is reminded of Dennis Prager's saw that \"the Left always demonizes what is flawed, and then substitutes something far worse.\"  Just this week, Castro admitted that Cuba's Communist economic model did not work, something that less blinkered people realized, oh, decades ago.  Had his squalid regime never taken hold in Cuba, great men like Armando Valladares would have never undergone the hideous sufferings enumerated in \"Against All Hope.\"", "images": [], "asin": "1893554198", "parent_asin": "1893554198", "user_id": "AHQSEYRK3EPE7TSJNHLLVRW6DCRQ", "timestamp": 1284079519000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Their determination and courage make for a captivating tale", "text": "A Florida adventure where three young protagonists (9 -15 yr olds) face real challenges all on their own. Published in 1946, the story is set in the more rudimentary \u201cOld Florida\u201d, less predictable than what we know today \u2013 a setting in which their challenges and some of the more caricatured characters seem quite believable. The adventure takes us on a sailboat from the Atlantic Coast, across tropical Florida, by way of rivers, canals and Lake Okeechobee, and out to the shell-strewn Sanibel and Captiva Islands on the Gulf. The boating theme is prominent right from the 2nd chapter. Some nautical terms left me in the dark, but I suppose that put me in a similar situation as the two younger characters who also find themselves suddenly thrown into this new nautical world.<br /><br />The story is told exclusively from the children's points of view, which effectively pulls the reader into their adventure. The straightforward narrative seems to reflect a child's refreshingly uncomplicated mindset. Like in a legend or fairytale, I liked the way the children had to earn the better life they were seeking, by taking on each new challenge however hard or even painful. Early on, before they have realized what they're capable of, one of the children feels \"a little afraid, a little as though everything they were doing was too big for them to do and they would have to stop.\" Surely those words speak to all of us of any age? But they don't give up and their determination and courage make for a captivating tale.<br /><br />The quick succession of events and exploration of a past, more natural Florida kept me turning pages. I particularly enjoyed how both the story and the artwork focused on Florida's wild face - its landscapes, creatures and close relationship with the natural elements. Ralph Ray\u2019s superb cover illustration most accurately captures the feel of the story and I also welcomed his atmospheric drawings within (though a few deviated from the text, but the sentiment still felt right).<br /><br />A great book for middle-grade readers (girls and boys alike), an animated read-aloud for slightly younger listeners and an enjoyable moment for anyone with a love for Florida or boating.", "images": [], "asin": "0982093209", "parent_asin": "0982093209", "user_id": "AFRBIOQ3VNXL2NP6SL6ZQZJJXLEQ", "timestamp": 1685735359365, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins", "text": "Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. [..]<br /><br />Even though Catching Fire wasn't as good as The Hunger Games, it is still a favorite of mine and a great sequel to The Hunger Games. I was worried, at first, that I wouldn't be able to jump back into the book because I wasn't really sure what could possibly go on in this book without Katniss and Peeta in the game anymore and just the fact that after reading The Hunger Games  I had VERY high expectations about it's sequel.<br /><br />I think this possibly might be my all-time favorite series now. But then I start thinking about all my other top favorite series and can't possibly choose.<br /><br />Catching Fire got so many reactions out of me, which a truly great book always does. I screamed and wanted to throw the book across the room so many times due to some of the events that happened. I was hit in the face so many times because I wasn't expecting the events to happen. Which I've always loved about these books because I've never been able to guess what would happen next.<br /><br />You can see that Katniss has grown a lot since being in the Hunger Games and you get to see the effect that it has had on her. Even though Katniss annoys me at times with the whole Peeta situation, I still love her as a main character.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this book. But absolutely HATE the cliffhanger at the end. I own the first two books, but don't have the last one yet, sadly. I went to put it on hold, being very happy I was going to be going to the library the next day, but to find that ALL 32 copies of the book that the library systems in my town has, were all UNAVAILABLE.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "If you can stomach the last 3 chapters you might enjoy this...", "text": "This book is a fascinating analysis of the development of the United States as we know it by analyzing the specific cultural groups that settled the nation. it is weighty and fairly dense in its information but it is thought provoking and makes sense when one looks at the current state of the nation in light of Woodard's analysis.<br /><br />What troubles me about the book is Woodard's bias against the Dixie Block. His last 30 pages seem to be a propaganda piece determined to undermine the values of this block by suggesting that what Dixie really wants is a &#34;Baptist Theocracy&#34;. His railing against right to work states and their determination to balance the power of unions turns what would have been a nicely written theoretical tool for analysis of the country into a handbook for validating East Coast Liberalism.<br /><br />One takes away from Woodard that he thinks that the only &#34;advanced&#34; region of the nation lies north of Virginia and on the West Coast and he ignorantly avoids discussing advanced technology areas of the South like Raleigh Durham and Huntsville. He further asserts that southern residents are determined to avoid acknowledging the truth of science if it is in conflict with Evangelical Christian worldview. Sadly he uses examples such as global warming and declining polar bear populations as methods of bolstering his point but fails to understand that these issues have already been scrutinized as seriously flawed and in the case of polar bear populations flatly wrong.<br /><br />As a resident of Appalachia and a college professor I find it sad that such bigoted and obviously misinformed ideas still remain in the USA but we also know that the Upper Eastern Seaboard has always felt itself superior to the rest of the nation with its social progressive values. This is something that Woodard actually acknowledges several times in the book and yet in the end manifests it himself by diverting from objective analysis and resorting to assaults on the shared values of a region he clearly does not understand.<br /><br />I found it interesting that he seemed not to grasp the fundamental concept of the US Constitution as a series of compromises designed to unit a nation and essential to the continued existence of the country. He tells you this early in the book but then seems to castigate the south for wanting to live by the individual rights guaranteed in the document. Further he suggests that a powerful central Federal Government is necessary for the continued existence of the nation without analyzing the notion of government as defined by the document of the Constitution and the notion of government as the system of feckless bureaucracies that seem to make the simple overly complex and generally mess with the liberties guaranteed in the Constitution that authorizes the government in the first place.<br /><br />I would recommend the book as long as you tear out the last 30 pages or simply understand that everything prior to that makes for good analysis and once you enter the last 3 chapters you are reading a hit piece that simply serves to further a Yankee leftist agenda.", "images": [], "asin": "0143122029", "parent_asin": "0143122029", "user_id": "AFMIWKA2CQ2MNRRMYHMDAQCEPWQA", "timestamp": 1408972175000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": true}

I\u2019d meant to read it back when it first came out, but it had gotten lost in my ever-growing to be read stack. So I took it home. When I realized that I couldn\u2019t renew it any more, I pushed it to the top of my stack after I finished Brazen. And I\u2019m so happy that I did! Lush with detail, political intrigue, forbidden romance, and unexpected humor, The Traitor\u2019s Kiss was a fantastic, feminist debut, and I can\u2019t wait for The Traitor\u2019s Ruin! Erin Beaty has become one of my new recent debut authors, and I\u2019m excited to see what she\u2019s got up her sleeve next.<br /><br />Sage Fowler, unlike other young women her own age, does not wish to get married. Fierce, sharp-tongued and the farthest thing from ladylike, she is deemed unfit for matrimony, and instead is apprenticed to a matchmaker, and is charged with wrangling the fine ladies that her mistress retains as clients, often for making political alliances. But she is so much more than she seems: she often spies on her clients in hopes of garnering information, and that also includes the soldiers who escort them across the countries. As whispers begin of a dangerous political uprising that could mean turning the tides of the war, she is recruited by a mysterious, attractive soldier to infiltrate the enemy\u2019s ranks. But the more discovers as a spy, she soon realizes that it is impossible to know who to trust, and she is trapped in a web of intrigue and danger that will determine the fate of her kingdom\u2026<br /><br />This book was really strong, especially considering that it was a debut. It seemed to jump several genres, combining lots of different elements to make something completely different. Romance, politically charged spy thriller, fantasy: It never seemed to make up its mind, as far as what it was, but that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. The pacing was brisk and exciting, and I liked the way that the book bounced between several different characters; it provided a lot of perspective to the different events that were happening. And the romance! Oh, my goodness, I was swooning more than once! I loved Sage, and the way that she bucked society\u2019s mores with fierce defiance, wanting to stay true to herself and do what she wished even while she fell in love. Alexander was one of my favorite characters, too, full of secrets of his own, and a bright conviction to his family and eventually to Sage. And that ending! At times, though, there were so many different characters and countries that I had a hard time keeping track of everything; I wish there had been a reference in the back of the book. Despite some little flaws, I can\u2019t wait to see what The Traitor\u2019s Ruin has in store! Erin Beaty has done a fabulous job with The Traitor\u2019s Kiss.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Strengths and Weaknesses - but this is a WINNER!", "text": "If you have a need for a Waterproof Bible, you will love it. I have to say I am surprised by some of the concerns raised in the negative reviews, as they are critiquing the product for things that are outside its control given the technology used to make it Waterproof. The best way to know whether this is the right purchase for you is to consider what you will be using it for and see if it matches your needs.<br />- Do you live, work, or play near water? We have lived near the beach the last two years and this Bible makes me read considerably more scripture than I would on my own given that I can take it to the beach in heat and humidity and not worry about any damage to the pages. I love it for this purpose! If you are not outdoors or near water, it would likely feel like a &#34;gimmick&#34; (as a previous review noted), since you have no need for the actual technology. If you are around water and like to read scripture, this Bible is a wonderful resource to own!<br />However, to make this technology possible, I'm sure the publisher had to sacrifice the things that others lament in its use. Things people complain about:<br />- Heaviness and size: Yes, it is heavy. Of course it is - these are not normal paper pages! A synthetic is going to weight more because the pages have to be made out of another material to be waterproof and it is heavy. It can't be smaller less it be un-readable. It can't be bigger or it would have to be even thicker and weigh more. Readers seem to forget that the publisher is tied to the limits of the technology. To my knowledge (and I do not know anyone who works for Bardin and Marsee), they are not the company that invented the technology, they license it and publish Bibles. We cannot expect them to defy physics and current science limitations to bring us a magical light-weight AND waterproof product. (Don't get me wrong, I'd love it to be lighter in my beach bag - but they make a version that is the Bible broken up into smaller books if that was important enough to me.)<br />- No margins for notes: Again, this comes down to the book size and weight. If there are larger margins, there is less room for text and the Bible has to be bigger. I think of this Bible as a complement to my normal Bible, the one I reach for when spending time outdoors. I don't need all the bells and whistles (margins, commentaries, etc.) - I need FUNCTION over that - the smallest, readable, waterproof version possible - and this Bible delivers in that regard.<br />Also, some lament the lack of traditional writing utensils working with the pages. I bought the space pen and dry highlighter from the publishers website, and those work fine. The space pen leaks a little, but apparently that is normal due to its pressurization. Again, a limit of the technology, but it is nice to be able to write so easily on the pages, and since it isn't my daily Bible it doesn't matter to me if there are some ink smudges. The highlighter is truly dry, think almost like a crayon.<br />So if you need a Bible to be waterproof, this is a great buy. If you need the bells and whistles of a traditional Bible, then you may want to look elsewhere.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great resource for beginners", "text": "I love this jam cookbook! I never made jam before this (June 2014) and thought it would be difficult just like everyone else thinks it is. I've canned over 700 jars in 6 months! This book makes it easy. I read the book probably twice before I started my jam making. The first section she talks about proper equipment, ripe fruit and how to tell your jam has properly set. I used the biggest and widest pot I own. Having a large pot is helpful in having more surface area to release more water from the fruit as steam. The pictures really help with knowing when your fruit has set and using the freezer test made it even easier to know when the fruit has set. She then goes into her different recipes and does so by season starting with winter. There some recipes that I wouldn't try just because they sound too odd but I imagine they are delicious.<br />There are times I have to re-read the recipe to understand what she is trying to say but all in all I think it is a well written book. I've taken her recipes and slightly changed them, like with her peach jam I've added fresh ginger, vanilla pods and cinnamon and nutmeg to it to add flavor to the peaches. I've never had a problem by using her method of sealing jars. I actually like it better cause you can do more jars at once. You heat you jars for 30 minutes at 250 then after you fill your jars and put the lids and bands on it goes back in for another 15 minutes at 250. Every jar I've done like this has sealed!<br />I love how she goes by weight instead of cups and doesn't use too much sugar and no pectin except for maybe 3 recipes. If you are looking to make jam but have no idea where to start I highly recommend this book.

That's a paraphrased summary from the prologue. Can I just say that I had a full-blown case of the creeps before the first chapter!<br /><br />The first POV is from Alex, who grabbed what would fit in the car along with her children Ollie and Kara and fled an abusive partner hoping to make a fresh start in Pine Ridge. She is scared, sleep-deprived from caring for her eight-month-old, and always on edge because of her contentious relationship with her teenage son. She ignores belligerent calls from her ex Stuart and only hopes that he cannot find them.<br /><br />While most of the people here are friendly Maggie seems to instantly dislike Alex. She can't understand why but soon she is faced with more pressing concerns. She hears strange noises and starts to receive terrible boxes full of bizarre \u2018gifts\u2019 and now Stuart isn't her biggest threat, it\u2019s figuring out who in Pine Ridge wants to hurt her family.<br /><br />The second POV is from Renee who lived in the farmhouse on the hill before this community was built. Her son Gabriel disappeared after bones, a doll, blood, and their house was vandalized. Her story is eerily similar to the nightmare Alex is experiencing. What is the connection between Alex and Renee?<br /><br />There are enough strange events in both timelines that kept me guessing if there was a supernatural entity in Pine Ridge or just an evil person who had remained quiet for years. Both plots come together nicely, and this was a story where nothing was what it seemed. In this case, I preferred Renee\u2019s storyline, mostly because Alex got on my nerves!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Literate, leisurely and edgy", "text": "In this atmospheric and leisurely Scottish mystery, youngish Murray Watson, Glasgow doctor of English literature, has taken a sabbatical to research his literary inspiration, the dead poet Archie Lunan. Drowned sailing in a storm off a remote island in the 1970s, Lunan, 25, left only one slim volume of poems.<br /><br />There are those - including Watson's department head, Fergus Baine, who think one volume was quite enough. Baine was against the project from the beginning and after a discouraging slog through the minimal record, Watson is beginning to wonder if Baine wasn't right after all.<br /><br />But then Watson is having an affair with Baine's wife, which might also explain his boss' general enmity. Interviewing every tenuous lead, from old drinking buddies in gritty pubs to Lunan's mentor, a secretive retired professor with a deep dislike of Fergus Baine, to an attractive young widow whose husband had an unhealthy interest in art and suicide, Watson decides to go to Lismore, where Lunan died and his lover, Christie, still lives.<br /><br />Christie has refused to have anything to do with Watson's project. She has even promised to have him prosecuted as a stalker if she catches sight of him. So Watson, while determined, is circumspect, probing the clannish islanders for information about the pair's history while ducking out of sight every time he sees Christie.<br /><br />Dr. Watson, like his namesake, is charmingly clueless. And for all that his personal life is a shambles, and his professional life is teetering, he still manages to be engaging rather than pathetic. The island - complete with a deserted limekiln village - is everything you could ask for: bleak, secretive, wet, rocky, muddy and romantic. And the central conundrum: why can't an artist's work stand on its own, without personal context muddying perceptions, is playful rather than pedantic.<br /><br />Welsh (The Cutting Room) delivers a literate novel full of prickly, demanding characters (except for hapless Watson who is more battered than battering, though he does try) with a wonderfully over-the-top macabre ending. Highly recommended for those who like their mysteries edgy, literate and not too bloody.", "images": [], "asin": "1934609668", "parent_asin": "1934609668", "user_id": "AHGVQCK4CN2MPB7YQHTZHJ5J4HJA", "timestamp": 1301581163000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}

Brown really had a lot of controversial topics that made for a dramatic read to include lesbianism, same-sex domestic violence, religion, sexual abuse and single parenthood.  Unfortunately about one-third of the way through, I really became annoyed by this book.  The drama just took over the plot and character development and as such both of these went lacking.  The story quickly became too much drama just for the sake of it.  With a few improvements Fire &amp; Brimstone could have been a really good read.  Some of the annoying aspects of the books included all the fighting between the two young ladies, the reasons given for why they were lesbians, lack  of strong character development( often one would be reading and  then it appeared that the roles of the characters would be reversed), finally there were numerous grammatical and typographical  errors throughout the book.  If one can overlook some of the glaring concerns listed above then Fire &amp; Brimstone was an okay read.

Anyways...<br /><br />There has been an upward trend in literature to try and take vampires and werewolves from the side of the monsters and turn them into romantic heroes and heroines. We can blame this on Anne Rice. Adding to the mix are the likes of Charlotte Harris, Jeannine Frost, Carrie Vaughn, Patricia Briggs, and Karen MacInerney (the first two are vampires, the last three are werewolves with vampires in the story). Notice a trend in the authors? Ray Garton, however, grabs the wolf by the shorthairs and claims a big nu-uh, werewolves are bad and this is why. Garton jumps right into a gore filled story with the first born werewolf offspring being... well... born.<br /><br />The town is being taken over by werewolf inhabitants, led by Sheriff Taggert. Into town come paranormal PIs Burgess and Keoph to find out whats going on and what happened to Daniel Fargo (evidently laid out in [[ASIN:0843958200 Ravenous]] which I didn't know was the first book because it wasn't on the shelf at the bookstore). So evidently werewolf-ism is passed on like a sexually transmitted disease in this storyline instead of the old legends of surviving a brutal attack. Either way, I don't care. Garton lays on the violence and sex quickly and forcefully, seemingly tossing the gore freely. It's fast and messy but a welcome relief from the current trend of romanticized monsters (don't get me wrong, I read Vaughn and Briggs and truly enjoy them).

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Unique Meet Cute - Friends to Lovers Romance", "text": "My sincere thanks to St. Martin's Griffin and NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to read this book and give my unbiased opinion of it in the following review.<br /><br />Too Wrong to be Right is the first book I've read by Melonie Johnson. This is a strangers to friends to lovers rom com that takes place in Chicago over a period of several months including the holiday season. The main character, Kat, is literally dumped at the beginning of the book by her shallow boyfriend who also leaves his pet hedgehog with her. She tells her girlfriends that she is over falling for good-looking jerks and makes a list of the attributes her forever man should have. Of course, the first guy she meets after making the list completely catches her interest but is nothing like her list. They have a fun \"meet cute\" at a funeral home where there was even a sarcastic bird named Seamus who added some spicy commentary that made me chuckle.<br /><br />I loved the character of Mick. He was at his own crossroads and trying to figure out which path he wanted his life to follow. He reluctantly finds himself in the friend zone with Kat and has to watch her date his brother because Joe DOES fit her criteria. At this point I was still liking the book a lot, but it started dragging and there was so much miscommunication or NO communication. There were a few steamy scenes that I thought were a bit awkward and, in my opinion, would have been better left out or maybe at least saved until the end. I did enjoy the author's writing style. I would be interested in trying another Melonie Johnson book in the future, maybe a story about Joe. Hint Hint. I can see lots of romance readers enjoying this, so will recommend to people I think would like it.

Now she is living in Conner's house in the country. Conner is her cousin and the brother of Dylan who was murdered by her own brother.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Delightful Key West Fun with a Serving of Murder", "text": "*Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book through an author Facebook giveaway in exchange for an honest review.*<br /><br />In this 6th installment of Lucy Burdette's Key West Food Critic mystery series, our protagonist Hayley Snow must contend with relationship and work issues while fighting to clear the name of everyone's favorite tarot card reader, Lorenzo, after he is accused of murder. The usual, colorful cast of characters is along for the ride, especially Ms. Gloria (who is training to work as a graveyard guide). Burdette has loaded this book with enough food descriptions and references to make anyone salivate, regardless of taste preferences.<br /><br />Con: Hayley's persistence in the face of naysayers is admirable (and I can only hope I have such dedicated friends), but sometimes she can be a bit foolhardy and frustrating. I also found it a bit hard to believe that she wouldn't immediately realize that it would be a bad idea to tell a restaurant owner about the contents of her review.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book as I have enjoyed the previous ones in the series--it's a good beach or pool-side cozy.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Black Swans in \"The Black Swan\"", "text": "There are true pearls in this book. Umberto Eco's &#34;Anti-Library,&#34; Yevgenia's story, Algazel's rejection of science, &#34;scalable&#34; jobs and the antechamber of hope (anyone working one of these jobs will relate strongly), are a few examples. The problem is that they are hard to find and come somewhat unexpectedly, i.e., they are black swans. I think the problem is that the author apparently set out to write some kind of &#34;treatise&#34; and felt that the book had to be a weighty 500-page tome, so he had to include a lot of filler. Properly edited, this could have been a delightful 200-page read. Sometimes the author is wrong: for example, he dismisses linear phenomena too casually. It is obvious that nothing is nature is linear, since this would require the response to increase or decrease without bound as the independent variable increases or decreases, which is an impossibility. This is called the &#34;Law of Diminishing Returns.&#34; The point is that many or even most phenomena behave linearly over a limited interval of interest. For example, a transistor is a linear device if biased (by means of proper voltage application) to its amplifying region, otherwise it behaves as a switch (as in digital devices). The author is prone sometimes to self-aggrandizing, but this is tempered with dashes of self-deprecating humor, making the reading tolerable. All in all, it's recommended.

Specifically Wharton, where reading this book makes it hard to believe it is a work of fiction since I now feel a part of all the families there and their Christmases past and present.<br /><br />In the first story, Fine Thread, you are visiting your grandfather's house and you remember exactly what it was like to be 10 years old there at Christmas....30 years earlier.<br /><br />Mary Ellen, despite her successful escape, takes us back to Wharton to face the ghosts of her past in The Wharton Echo.<br /><br />In Snowflake, 12 year old Thomas Mullen and his grandfather lead us through a Christmas Eve in 1985 that turns magical and although we know \"nothing lasts forever,\" we find that Christmas is a time for wishing and remembering and perhaps that is what lasts forever.<br /><br />Seasons' Greeting is a great title for this wonderful story as indeed the seasons are plural!<br /><br />Then there's my favourite character - lovable, comical Carlton, in Ninety Degrees who spends a riotous Christmas Eve at the hospital.<br /><br />All the stories come together in a nice, neatly wrapped package in Christmas Day and throughout them all we see Dr. Glover.<br />Dr. Glover is just one of the reasons I love this book. In 1985 Dr. Glover had been the town's medical practitioner for 53 years.  He is the connecting thread throughout all of the stories.  He seemed to be at the grassroots of the small town and grew with it over the years, along with his expanding girth!  But the good doctor is not without fault.<br /><br />Christmas at Grandfather's House has a powerful, pleasing, all encompassing quality, brilliant in its ambiguity and now is sine qua non on my bookshelf!  It brims with interesting characters, and they all make me feel that they are as real as the people in my own family.<br /><br />As in the author's own words regarding snowflakes...\"each precious gem carrying with it a simple but true promise of Christmas\"....and so each of the tightly connected stories that make up Christmas at Grandfather's House are gems unto themselves with each story having its own unique theme: love, salvation, hope, forgiveness - to name a few - and the overall motif of the book culminates with a humanness all its own.<br /><br />To see what happens to Dr. Glover, Tommie, Carlton, Mary Ellen and the rest of the people who love, live and breath in Christmas at Grandfather's House, you'll need to read the book!", "images": [], "asin": "0978305906", "parent_asin": "0978305906", "user_id": "AERZ45Y5CIB5AES427L7PNYHBFVA", "timestamp": 1186650920000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Useful, but you need two sets", "text": "I like the D&D dungeon tiles.  I use them often in the campaign that I run and I find their modularity to be powerful for setting up interesting encounters quickly.<br /><br />With dungeon tiles I can almost always find appropriate tiles for the situation that I'm looking for, whether it be a forest scene, swamp, desert, generic indoor dungeon, or cave system. Indoor non-dungeon scenes are a bit harder to arrange due to the lack of good wall and room tiles, though recent sets have tried to make this better.<br /><br />Along comes a set that seeks to further fill one of my major problem areas - ramparts.  Until now I have not had good rampart tiles.  There have been a few of the 8x2 strips in previous sets that could be used to emulate castle walls, but nothing that really fit the bill well. This is where Castle Grimstead comes in.<br /><br />Grimstead has rampart tiles, moat tiles, a gate tile, and tower tiles. It also has indoor tiles showing rooms such as a guard's room (complete with weapon racks and a game of cards being played on a small table), a small throne/audience chamber, a modest dining area (much smaller than the large horseshoe table from the previous sets), entrance chamber, and a small sleeping room with three beds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the rooms are printed on the back side of other rooms, so there is no good way to use one set to build a castle. You effectively need to buy two sets to make a complete castle encounter unless you want to pick up and re-lay your tiles (which I find time-intensive, not to mention having to remember which tiles go where).<br /><br />I'm not opposed to buying two sets, and in fact I generally do buy two copies of each dungeon tile set for exactly this reason, but I really wish that WotC would release the sets in double-quantity so that only one purchase would need to be mafe.<br /><br />Aside from that, no complaints.  Durability is the same as previous sets, artwork is good, theme is good, tiles are usable and of the size I want (no silly 1x1 tiles and only one 2x1 tile), and the cost is reasonable.", "images": [], "asin": "0786960396", "parent_asin": "0786960396", "user_id": "AF4EPJDYTWM5CCIBWWUNOQNE2IFQ", "timestamp": 1348183150000, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": true}

This is a bold writing decision and Hillier did a fantastic job keeping the suspense high throughout the entire novel despite this huge twist at the very beginning.<br /><br />Edward Shank recently retired from his position as Chief of Police in Seattle. He is a local legend because he was the detective who tracked down and killed the serial killer aptly named \u201cThe Butcher\u201d in 1985.  Matthew Shank, his grandson, is an up-and-coming chef who owns an extremely successful restaurant. He was gifted his childhood home when Edward decides it\u2019s time to move into a retirement community. Sam, Matt\u2019s girlfriend, is a true crime writer who is busy doing research for a new novel.  The relationships among these three characters become more intense as they work toward their own personal goals.  Edward meets new \u201cfriends\u201d in his new community, Matthew finds something disturbing while doing back yard renovations, and Sam comes closer to discovering who really killed her mother.<br /><br />If you\u2019re as shocked by the first few chapters as I was, just go ahead and get comfortable and prepare yourself for a wild ride.

The two things simply do not exist, except as the vaguest of constructs.<br /><br />The editors and a couple of the writers strain to show that anti-feminist movements and internet sites are a gateway to the nationalist and racialist Right, or as they like to say, \"white supremacism.\" They have this argument backwards, however. While there was an overlap between the two worlds, this wasn't because one was feeding the other, but because there was little downside risk in appearing to be feminist-critical or in pronouncing onself \"redpilled.\" This was in much the same way that people will sometimes mask themselves as libertarians or even neoreactionaries.<br /><br />Much of the book is spent on stale references to \"the manosphere,\" \"GamerGate,\" and the \"alt-right\": thus a 2013-2015 mindset predominates. Richard Spencer is mentioned seven times.<br /><br />We linger at length on the career and works of Phyllis Schlafly and Gavin McInnes, for both of whom the writers have a grudging admiration. There is some unintended humor in the McInnes section, as when we're told that membership in Proud Boys (which McInnes founded in July 2016) was limited to \"cis men.\" And the chapter's author apparently had never heard of the Knights of Columbus; she believes it to be a front for \"fundamentalist right-wing think tanks,\" which would passing strange indeed for a Catholic laymen's organization.<br /><br />Most of the URLs given for endnote and index references are old and broken.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very good biography of CAPT Stenhouse", "text": "Having spent two Winters at McMurdo, Antarctica, I was aware of CAPT Stenhouse being the master of the ship, the Aurora, for ten months from May 1915 - March 1916 when it became trapped in the pack ice. CAPT Aeneas Mackintosh took the Aurora to Cape Evans (where CAPT Robert's Scott's hut was located during the Terra Nova Expedition of 1910-1913) in McMurdo Sound as leader of the Ross Sea Party to support the laying of food caches for Sir Ernest Shackleton's attempt to cross the Antarctic Continent from the Weddell Sea via the South Pole to Cape Evans in Sir Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (ITAE).<br /><br />In May 2015 the Aurora was secured to anchors at Cape Evans when a major storm came up and broke the lines, locking the ship in the pack-ice which slowing drifted North towards New Zealand. At the time Captain Mackintosh was leading sledging trips but became one of ten men trapped on the ice for the next two years. As the Chief Officer aboard the Aurora when the ship became ice-locked and adrift, CAPT Stenhouse took command. On the other side of the continent Sir Shackleton's Endurance was also trapped in the pack-ice at the same time. CAPT Frank Worsley, the master of this ship, was a friend of CAPT Stenhouse. The legacy of CAPT Worsley (along with Sir Shackleton) managing to get 28 men in three life boats to Elephant Island, and then further navigating 800 miles in the James Caird to South Georgia Island is famous in the history of Antarctic exploration, but CAPT Stenhouse's role in leading the Aurora is every bit as impressive, but not nearly as well known. This was the major extent on my knowledge until I read Ice Captain. I bought the book to find out more, but CAPT Stenhouse's time and role in the ITAE is but a fraction of the nearly 40 years he lived life as a sailor. World War I was still going on when he made it back to England; he and CAPT Worsley then hunted German U-Boats. After the war ended, CAPT Stenhouse ended up in the Russian Arctic in an attempt to curb the Bolshevics, he then became the commander of CAPT Scott's Discovery ship in a scientific expedition. Throw in some treasure hunting and nurturing ideas of Antarctic tourism, again with CAPT Worsley, plus some World War II participation, and the reader can easily tell that CAPT Stenhouse wasn't the kind of man to sit down on the beach and warm up rocking chairs looking at sunsets.<br /><br />Mr. Haddelsey performed extensive research on this book,and thoroughly documented it. Though out, he wrote of the friendship between the two Captains, and just as importantly, CAPT Stenhouse's love of the sea.", "images": [], "asin": "0750943483", "parent_asin": "0750943483", "user_id": "AFKBM7AWVQ37WYCR4K5HYCEZ4LLQ", "timestamp": 1394744221000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Realistic coming of age novel with classic scifi storytelling, an authentic voice, and magical realism (or insanity?)", "text": "This month is ace for great books so far. Huzzah! I received this book in a swap (I'd never heard about it before), and I didn't really read the synopsis- I don't think I would have picked it up myself. But shame on me, because it was really good!<br /><br />Essentially, this book is a coming of age story. With magic (set in the late 1970s, in Wales and England). The voice of the protagonist is achingly real- the entire story is her diary entries, so we see the world through her eyes. She doesn't want to think or talk about her mother (or her father, much), nor does she go into what happened to her twin sister.<br /><br />In fact, for the first half of the book I was thinking she was an unreliable narrator (maybe insane, as she claims her mother is) and by the end of the book I was *still* wondering how much of this stuff was in her head. Real for her, but not for the rest of us. That's the magic of this book- the system of magic is &#34;always deniable&#34;, and makes a beautiful sort of rule-less sense, so of course the entire story is also deniable. And breaks conventional rules of storytelling.<br /><br />If you go into this novel expecting an epic showdown, as the synopsis hints, you will be disappointed. The pace is steady but slow, with little to no rising action until the climax itself (in the last 10 pages of the book). But the language, and the process of Mor essentially crawling into the world (not giving up her books, but not hiding behind them of her past anymore), is the true story.<br /><br />I was surprised this won a Hugo, because the narrator's primary positive experiences with the world are with fairies, which always seem a fantasy element to me. But Mor is an avid reader, and loves science fiction (and given the setting, her SciFi books are the classics) and talks at length about the brilliance or insipidness of the books she's reading. So in a way, it felt like this real person (or perhaps the author? It does feel somewhat autobiographical) was recommending books directly to me.<br /><br />If you like thoughtful, unique novels that aren't necessarily an adventure story, classic science fiction, magical realism, contemporary coming of age (where love isn't the trite answer to everything), a potentially unrealiable narrator, and an authentic MC voice, I highly recommend this one.", "images": [], "asin": "0765331721", "parent_asin": "0765331721", "user_id": "AGGKRBR6G6TOQXFGVW5RME24YLYQ", "timestamp": 1511452138367, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "native Alaskan, Alaska Native.", "text": "I agree with several concerns about the text. Still I value this text especially for providing a clear distinction between Alaska Native and native Alaskan. Alaska Native refers to a cultural group of First Nations people within Alaska. The markers for Alaska Native include a distinctive language, traditional use boundaries that include what is today Alaska, histories, dance, legends and social organization. The term native Alaskan is anyone born within the territory or state of Alaska.<br />Failing this distinction results in social and political confusion by journalists, politicians and the general public. The result of failing on this are repeated argument and views framed as &#34;I'm a native Alaskan, why can't I use the Native hospital, or get checks from the Native corporations?&#34;.  This point of view only arises from the conflation of these terms. A person can be both native Alaskan and Alaska Native. A person can be one or the other. If these become verbal mush only ignorance wins. Both terms have and need their boundaries respected.<br />I am agnostic about much of the rest but this point needs to be sent as engraved script to every person who self describe as a journalist.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "you'll want to own the entire series!", "text": "I am a fan of Rowena Cherry. No doubt about it. She's a stellar writer, and her worlds are incredibly intricate. Not to mention the fact that her Djinn Princes are mouth-wateringly hot and scrumptious. To boot, she has a great dry wit, that classic English humor found in Monty Python and other greats.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be gifted an advance copy of KNIGHT'S FORK, book three in Rowena's Tigron/Djinn Princes. What a gift! It hasn't been long since I've read the first two novels in this series (FORCED MATE and INSUFFICIENT MATING MATERIAL), though I read the novella more than a year ago (MATING NET). Still, I don't think this world would diminish, even if it had been years for all of them.<br /><br />Like all the books in this series, the title is based on a chess move or situation. A \"Knight's Fork\" arises when an opponent's knight is faced with two of your pieces, and you must choose to save one, knowing that the danger still looms for the other. In short, it's the proverbial \"rock and a hard place\" situation.<br /><br />For Prince Djarrhett, The Saurian Djinn, trouble comes from all sides.<br /><br />He's taken a vow of chastity, in a large part due to his \"unfortunate childhood accident of fate.\" Read that as a bout of human mumps leaving him a very virile and potent Djinn but incapable of experiencing the rut-rage. That is both a blessing and a curse to him, since it means he isn't dangerous, when a fertile Djinn woman is around, but it also means he can't experience the imprinting, which will make him crave the first female Djinn who is rut-rageous he scents.<br /><br />He's pursued by the Queen Consort of the Volnoth, Electra-Djerroldina (Prince Tarrant-Arragon's older sister). Her pursuit isn't completely carnal, though. Electra was mated to the youngest Volnoth prince to seal an alliance between Tigron and Volnoth, a mating that was never expected to bring forth children. Who knew his father and older brothers would be killed off, leaving Viz-Igerd with the impossible task of impregnating the wife he loves? Electra has no wish to commit body-treason (adultery) with Rhett. All she wants is his semen to accomplish a pregnancy she might pass off as her beloved husband's...and perhaps prepare her reticent body to carry a child that Viz-Igerd would sire later.<br /><br />He's on an impossible quest, namely proving his unstable half-brother Devoron has rut-raged on a full Djinn female on Earth, Demetra, who is believed dead.<br /><br />He's temporary guardian and male role model to a spoiled and deceptively-innocuous half-Djinn prince (Thor-quentin, the younger of Tarrant-Arragon's nephews from his younger sister Martia-Djulia).<br /><br />Oh, and let us not forget the devious Saurian Dragon (aka Rhett's father), who will do anything up to sacrificing his son to break the alliance between Tigron and Volnoth...and the \"Wicked Tarrant-Arragon,\" who believes his older sister guilty of body-treason and sees only one way to save her life...<br /><br />Okay...you MIGHT believe that I've told you the whole book. You'd be dead wrong. This is just where the book jumps off into an amazing array of plots within plots and reversals of fortune. Even when you think you know what's coming next, you never really do with Rowena's books, which is one of the reasons I adore her writing.<br /><br />The characters are delightful, as always. Rhett is, by far, the most morally-centered and least foul-tempered of the Djinn princes, not a great surprise, since he can't rut-rage. Electra is a woman who is caught between two men that she deeply cares about, neither one of which she wishes to hurt. Even her pining husband, Vis-Igerd, is a delight to the senses. He's confused and angry, but all he really wants is what is best for Electra and his people, even if it doesn't feel right for him.<br /><br />The world continues to grow and entrance. Rowena leaves the reader with just enough questions to make you want to preorder the next book in the series...NOW. There are still secrets that need uncovered, and discerning readers will be salivating for them.<br /><br />I can't wait to find out who gets a story next. Will it be Devoron? It seems set up to facilitate that.<br /><br />At any rate, this entire series wins a place on my keeper shelf. Kudos and two thumbs up to Rowena Cherry for a winning series!", "images": [], "asin": "0505527405", "parent_asin": "0505527405", "user_id": "AH77HAJKPLRFVIN6AYBIYILLXGMA", "timestamp": 1221770850000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}

After serving as managing editor of the Daily News for a couple of years, he returned to writing with a series of national columns for the Scripps-Howard Alliance group about the unusual places he saw and people he met in his travels. His articles were written in a folksy style, much like a personal letter to a friend, and enjoyed a following in some 300 newspapers.  With America's entry into World War II, he became a special war correspondent, covering actions in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily, and D-Day, writing from the perspective of the common soldier, an approach that won him the Pulitzer Prize in 1944. Pyle decided to cover events in the Pacific, and on April 18, 1945, was struck in the left temple by Japanese machine-gun fire on Ie Shima, an island off Okinawa, and died instantly.  James Tobin's account of Pyle's life and work, emphasizing his efforts during the war, won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998.<br />  One of the disadvantages of a biography is that one often has to read about \"warts and all.\"  Pyle's wife Jerry, who called herself an atheist, suffered from intermittent bouts of mental illness and alcoholism.  Pyle himself dealt with severe emotional insecurities and was a heavy drinker.  Jerry just wanted them to live together, but Pyle at least insisted on marriage because \"he could not shame his parents by living in sin.\"  The only time Jerry got pregnant, she chose to have an abortion, and she tried to commit suicide a couple of times.  Because of the problems they divorced in 1942, and there are references in the book to several affairs that Pyle had during this time, but they remarried by proxy a year later.  Also, Pyle and many of his co-workers, and apparently the author too, were very profane and vulgar men.  Their language is liberally sprinkled with cursing (especially the \"d\" and \"h\" words), a lot of taking the Lord's name in vain (including various forms of \"go**am\"), and even some actual obscenities (such as the \"f\" and \"s\" words among others).  The book ends with an Appendix that contains a potpourri of Pyle's articles.  For very mature, older teens and adults making an in-depth study of World War II, the book contains some important information, but it is definitely not for children.  This book is not to be confused with Ernie's War, a collection of Pyle's World War II dispatches edited by David Nichols.", "images": [], "asin": "0743284763", "parent_asin": "0743284763", "user_id": "AFOC4N6GVE66SK2MDDMFKA4U7P2A", "timestamp": 1340804988000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just can't get enough!", "text": "The sequel to Dungeon Lord does not fail to live up to the expectations set forth by its predecessor.  The book pretty much picks up where the last one left off, and we finally get to see some upgrades being made to the Keep.  Lord Wraith, Edward is better known, has to remain hidden for fear of attracting those pesky players, of whom he used to be one.  The one thing that I like the most about this series is that Edward, the Dungeon Lord, relies less on his powers than he does his head.  He often manages to outthink, outmaneuver, and out man his opponents in some way.  I think that the best, and the most admirable thing about him is that he trusts his people, and relies on them doing what he needs, rather than making them follow his every command to the letter.  That is the real strength to this story, not the magic, not the setting, not the magic, but the characters, their personalities, and their interactions with one another.  Personally, I think the thing I really respect the most about Edward is he never give up attitude.  He never caves when a lesser person would.<br /><br />The first book had some honest to God creepy horror tones to it, which are lacking here.  While the story is full of great new characters, different situations, and a great villain it never really achieves the nightmare tone that pervaded the last third of book one.  However, that is fine, because the work that Annie Ellicott did there is absolutely haunting and is not something that you will easily forget.  I still linger on it in my mind, and so am glad that this becomes a straight up action adventure novel set in a mystical land that doubles as an MMORPG known as Ivalis to the unwitting Earthlings who play the game.  Players who never realize that their actions actually have real-world consequences.<br /><br />A few things that surprised me is that Edward hasn\u2019t, as of yet encountered anyone that he played with while on Earth.  I\u2019m sure that that will pop up in book three, just as the newly revealed villain for book three also looms in the background here as foreshadowed in the Epilogue.  I also appreciated the team building that Edward does and was impressed by the fact that he puts himself right on the line when it came to training.  I kept waiting for montage music to pop up from Sound Booth Theater, but alas an opportunity was passed by.<br /><br />As for the narration, Soundbooth Theater really takes this stick and runs with it.  Whereas in the first book, Annie stole the show as the sympathetic monster, Jeff dominates and Annie plays the ladies.  Jeff really carries this story, although he has handed the reigns of playing the female characters over to Ellicott (since this is just her second book).  Annie does play a magnificent love interest for Edward, however, and I would love to see more of that character in the future.  Jeff meanwhile manages to pick up his narrator\u2019s role with his chameleon-like voice and steals this book away from Huesca.  It might be Hugo\u2019s baby, but Hays makes it grow up fast.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that the combination of SBT and Huesca rates a five star across the board score.  The book makes you want to have the next novel in your hand, and while it is not at the same level as the first book (due to the loss of the utterly insane horror element provided by Ellicott\u2019s voice) it is a powerful stand-alone book that makes me wish I could at least play a game or two of Ivalis, and possibly get an invite from the evil God Murmur to go play on his world.  I firmly believe that you will have no problem loving and enjoying this book.<br /><br />Audiobook was provided for review by the author/narrator/publisher.<br />Please find this complete review and many others at my review blog.<br />[If this review helped, please press YES.

It's the second book about poetic craft I read this week by Hoagland. The first was Real Sofistikashun which was also fabulous. If I had to differentiate between the two, I'd say that the RS provided a touch more practical advice on poetic choice making and aesthetics. This book also does plenty of that , but it focuses more on discussing those choices through the study of some fantastic individual poets. The chapters on Robert Bly and Dean Young alone are worth buying this book for. I am incredibly thankful for Hoagland's wealth of poetic knowledge, but even more so for his repeated (in both books) and courageous contention that American poetry needs BOTH the poets and poetics of fragmentation and chaos and the poets and poetics of the rage for order and balance. He clearly understands the variety of techniques &#34;difficult&#34; poets use to make their poems quite obscure and sometimes impenetrable. Hoagland has respect for these poets and for many of the poems--which happen to be the fashion of the day. But he's not cowed by the sometimes dismissive intellectualism of this poetics and offers elegant and compelling alternatives (the chapter about Marie Howe for instance) throughout.", "images": [], "asin": "1555976948", "parent_asin": "1555976948", "user_id": "AF4FJU6OWNZK64HABAMDXRRTRP5Q", "timestamp": 1431519316000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Sad, tragic, disturbing", "text": "First, I absolutely hate Amazon's &#34;rating system&#34; where I am forced to go through a checklist before I can make my comments. Neither &#34;predictable,&#34; &#34;some twists&#34; or &#34;full of surprises&#34; has anything to do with what I want to say. WHY does Amazon force us to do this before making a comment, I don't get it.<br /><br />On to the book: This is a translation from the original Japanese. I live in Japan and speak some Japanese and can only imagine the level of expertise required by the translator in order to pull this off. For that, I say &#34;Bravo!&#34;<br /><br />The problem is not with the language, which is sometimes brilliant. The problem is with the actual story and characters. Yukio Mishima was a deeply, deeply conflicted, closeted, troubled, and brilliant homosexual. He was not allowed to be who he really needed to be, and his entire view of self and how he fit into society was formed by those restrictions.<br /><br />This story is obviously a thinly veiled view of himself. His hatred of himself and of women and his absolute total disconnect from anything having to do with a sense of love for himself or others, dictates his every thought. It's really hard to to read about such a troubled, sad person with such an incredibly warped sense of himself and others.<br /><br />He is fixated on a beautiful young man, but in such a sick obsessive way as to make one want to close the book. I have not yet been able to finish it, and I've felt sick to my stomach. What this story has done, though, is to really shine a light on the sad, closeted, hell-filled lives of some men who struggled with their homosexuality in an era where it was essentially impossible to accept such feelings in oneself.<br /><br />If you do further research on Mishima, you will begin to understand what a truly tortured soul he was.<br /><br />This book opens a window to that deeply sad, sick world. I really wanted to grab him out of it and get him into psychotherapy as soon as possible and into a loving relationship. The protagonist (and I imagine Mishima) may never have known true love in any sense, from family, friend or lover.

We lost Brady, our beloved yellow lab, last year.  He was only eight when he died, and had also suffered from a copper storage problem, which almost killed him at age 4.  We realized the need to be very careful when selecting the next breeder with whom to work. and thought we had found such a place.  I mentioned to my neighbor that we were ready to begin looking for another pup, and he suggested I read Cary's book.<br /><br />Wow, am I ever glad I took his advice.  Her book is not only a fascinating read, it is also incredibly illuminating.  I had been so naive about the world of dog breeders, thinking that if their website says they do all the genetic testing, and that the dogs are AKC registered, then one could take that at face value.  As you read this book, you will learn just how wrong that assumption is.  I am sure there are plenty of very reputable and honest breeders out there, but this book gives an inside look into just how someone who makes a living off breeding dogs can find their business spiraling out of control, resulting in corners being cut, with both the dogs and their new owners suffering tremendous pain and suffering.<br /><br />Not only is this book a riveting tale of just such a breeder's downfall, despite her best intentions, it also highlights some of the red flags one can be aware of when searching for a breeder.<br /><br />Thank you, Cary, for taking the time to write such a thorough and comprehensive book.  I am certain it will help many people avoid involvement with disreputable puppy mills, and hopefully put some of them out of business.

There should have definately been more information about Addie she was as complex a person as one could be.  I also feel the author was sympathetic to Zack and I have no idea why he would be.  Zach made one poor choice after another.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Tina has two mommies", "text": "\"The Old Maid\" is quintessential Edith Wharton -- it takes place in Gilded Age New York City, in the genteel upper crust where human passions are hidden under lace and gilt. And despite its length, this novella is a passionate one, focusing on two women whose ordinary, pleasant lives are disrupted by a secret they both share.<br /><br />Delia Ralston has the \"perfect\" life -- a dependable husband, two children, and a lovely expensive home. But then her cousin Charlotte (newly engaged to Delia's cousin-in-law) bursts in with a shocking confession: a few years ago she gave birth to an illegitimate baby, fathered by Delia's ex-boyfriend. And if she goes ahead with the wedding, she will have to give up her daughter.<br /><br />After the initial shock, Delia contrives a way for Charlotte to have her daughter. She must remain an old maid, and retire to the countryside with little Tina.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple decades, and Charlotte is now living with the widowed Delia. Tina has grown into a beautiful, vivacious young woman, who considers Delia her \"Mamma\" and Charlotte as dowdy, fusty \"Aunt Chatty.\" When a young man starts paying special attention to Tina, but reveals he cannot afford to marry her, both Delia and Charlotte begin to fear that history will repeat itself. But any solution means that one of them will lose her.<br /><br />\"The Old Maid\" takes place in the same elegantly exalted New York as \"The Age Of Innocence\" -- many of the families and characters of that story are mentioned, and one even knows Tina. And in a way, it deals with a lot of the same problems: \"the dark destinies coiled under the safe surface of life,\" with human passions safely hidden behind proper societal expectations.<br /><br />Wharton's prose is elegant and polished, but often rips away the pretty veneer to show us the ugly and/or wilder side of human nature. The best example of it is near the end, where she lulls you with damask roses, orange and moonlight, and then unleashes all the hidden bitterness and sorrow that Charlotte had been hiding.<br /><br />And she spins up a truly spellbinding pair of characters in Delia and Charlotte -- one is a woman of passion and intensity who must quash it down for the sake of her daughter, while the other is a dull \"conventional\" woman until that same girl causes her maternal love to bloom. The secret they share brings them together, but it also causes some ugly feelings to arise.<br /><br />Like the society of Old New York, \"The Old Maid\" is elegant and beautifully written, but with highly-charged emotions running under the surface. A must read.<br /><br />(Just a warning: this novella has been printed elsewhere as part of the \"Old New York\" omnibus.)", "images": [], "asin": "0812970020", "parent_asin": "0812970020", "user_id": "AHVIMKECEZDXXK5QIGX7KWJPN6DQ", "timestamp": 1331674124000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

It concentrates on what the British did  (and why) without confusing the reader with unnecessary histories of other  countries.<br />Emerging from the 650 pages of this book is the truth of how  the Empire came about, and why it was inevitable and necessary that it  should be dissolved. The legacy of the British Empire to the world in terms  of culture, government and social structure are patiently chronicled.<br />The  insights into British public opinion throughout the period of Empire by the  analysis of newspapers, novels (and childrens' books) and movies were very  interesting.<br />This is the sort of book that can be read selectively and as  such would be an ideal text book for education in schools around the world,  or at least in the countries that were directly effected by the subject  matter.<br />The book has the capacity to make one want to talk at length  about the rich topic of the Empire.

The book provides a most interesting background on railroading back then. It shows how tenuous even an experienced and talented worker's job was. An accident or illness could easily terminate one's career. In this case the engineer contracted what today would be a minor but rare problem, a thyroid goiter, apparently from dietary insufficiency of iodine (a tragedy in itself). In my childhood in Indiana it was common to see people, usually women, walking around with huge untreated goiters the size of medium cantaloupes on their necks.  His suffering and the travails of going places back then, even from Roanoke to Cleveland to have surgery, was a major problem. In the end, the surgery was complicated by infection and BL died at a premature age.  A terrible tragedy that today would be unthinkable. A story of a family torn apart by tragedy.

The logic behind this thought is that some people want to write thick books to impress the readers but due to the lack of content they end up putting everything in big fonts to fill the pages. This seems to be the case.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Baby, you can drive my car", "text": "I was looking for a good scary book to read in the fall (this time of year, when it's getting dark out early, seems to be the best time to get into a good horror novel) so I went with the most famous horror novelist today, Stephen King.  CHRISTINE is one of his more famous novels (there's a movie version as well) and since I hadn't read that one yet, I decided to give it a try.  Turns out that while I did get a decent read, I didn't get one that really scared me.  It's an engrossing and enjoyable story, but it didn't really scare me the way I hoped it would.<br /><br />Here's the problem: the book is about a haunted, psychotic car, and cars aren't inherently frightening things.  Oh sure, if you're flying down the highway in heavy traffic and your brakes fail, or your accelerator cuts out, then, yeah, that's terrifying.  But lying awake at night and imagining that the strange noises that you can barely hear are really the sounds of an unruly automobile?  No, not scary.  The book, therefore, goes more for gross-out horror than psychological fear, which is fine if that's what you're looking for.  I was disappointed in that I was hoping for something with more of a creepy atmosphere.<br /><br />So, considering that cars are scarier in actuality than they are in the abstract, where does this book succeed?  Well, it does very well when it sticks to its characters.  King's characters aren't particularly deep, but with five hundred pages to work with, he certainly puts a lot into them.  This is where the book works, when it's dealing with the problems and relationships of its characters.  I had not been overly impressed by the characters at the beginning, but towards the end I had genuinely begun to care about them and their fates.  And the book is more horrific when presenting us with a good old-fashioned ghost tale instead of a less than thrilling possession-of-an-inanimate-object story.<br /><br />CHRISTINE is a five hundred page novel that never bored me, so I shouldn't dwell on the negatives too much.  While King's prose style here wouldn't be described as sophisticated, it is strikingly readable.  It's an undemanding read and certainly enjoyable and even fun in a way.  I just wish it had been a little scarier.", "images": [], "asin": "0451160444", "parent_asin": "0451160444", "user_id": "AHNMLXEXAR4KDHH7PZ3F3CODFORQ", "timestamp": 1101087810000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

With 22 activities in total, there are obviously more activities. Most of them require very basic supplies and you will not find yourself looking all over for the supplies. A few of them require a trip to a store to find  something you might not have on hand- a metal lunch box, for example, is required for the guitar.<br /><br />Many of these activities are incredibly easy to make and it is something a teenage girl (or boy) might be able to make on their own. Some of the activities will most likely require help in the form of an adult for safety (making soap) and sometimes the help needed is just an extra pair of hands to hold and stabilize. The directions were clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />Overall, there were some activities that caught the fancy of my daughter and she got excited about them.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "My least favorite of the series thus far. Very disappointing.", "text": "Look, I'm a big fan of KS and have been eagerly anticipating this next installment in the series. Unfortunately, this flopped. In my opinion, anyway.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Another KS book. Nice learning a bit more about his relationship with Incarnates. But it's only teased, nothing specific.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Problem 1: The whole Electra relationship just feels off. She comes off as incredibly manipulative and jealous in this book, and I actually liked her as a character elsewhere.  Not so much here. I get they're trying to figure out their relationship as friends post-breakup, but this just didn't seem believable.  And that pulled me out of the story.<br /><br />2) General plot. This just didn't advance the overall storyline.  The first mission with Gray was interesting and a good start, but then nothing comes of it. Not to mention the fact that Mouse, his mentor, is totally cool with Gray essentially blackmailing Jim into whatever he wants. But then again nothing comes of it.  And then in comes Ursula who is supposed to be more powerful than him. But this whole book was basically about Ursula's borrowed power, Kane's graduation..... and that's it. I didn't learn anything new about KS here, except for the 'shadow' thing, which again didn't go anywhere. This was really just a filler.  Even though it was a KS book, it didn't feel like KS was the main character. He was basically just an observer into the final fight. But even then, something else did the fighting.<br /><br />Very disappointed. Hopefully the next book will make KS more central to the plot line, and/or allow him to shine again.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fascinating ideas about history and the future", "text": "James C. Bennett explores some reasons for why English speaking names with an English heritage have done so well over the last couple centuries, and why they will continue to do well.  The author points out that history is a pretty good indicator of the future.  If we can understand why certain cultures have been successful, we may be able to understand which cultures will do well in the future.<br /><br />This book is full of interesting ideas and observations.  One of them is there are two types of problems, bounded and unbounded.  Bounded problems have clear answers.  A simple bounded problem is what is \"2 + 2\" with a clear answer of four.  There are more complex bounded problems, like how much fuel with a 747 use carrying 187 people from Chicago to Atlanta.  The problem is well defined, and the issues are all pretty much all known.  Unbounded problems do not have clear definitions, let alone clear answers, at least in the beginning.  Which video format is going to dominate, VHS or Beta?  Who is going to win the next presidential election?  What recent technological developments will become important in the future?  This reminded me of \"The Wisdom of Crowds\" by James Surowiecki.  James Surowiecki says that under certain situations a large group of people can make better decisions than a few experts.  James Bennett points out that often the private sector does a much better job of dealing with unbounded problems, and that the culture of the Anglosphere tends to promote private sector solutions.<br /><br />Another interesting idea builds on the economic principle that specialization with trade allows greater economic development.  If an individual had to depend on everything he produced he would have to be a subsistence farmer and/or hunter.  But as families, communities, cities, and nations develop, along with the ability to trade with others, people can increase their productiveness by focusing on specific areas of interest or expertise.  Adam Smith used showed the value of this when talking about a group of manufactures who each focused on a single step in the production of sewing needles.  James Bennett says that by increasing the level of trade and trust to include other nations, there can be greater economic growth.  Those nations in the Anglosphere have an easier time trading with each other, which allows even more specialization.  It is hard to trade with those who you don't trust, or those who have different cultural expectations.  So the Anglosphere has a great advantage in having a large network to work with.<br /><br />The book explores the idea of separating physical space, from transportation space, and from communication space.  We measure the physical space in miles.  But transportation space is largely influenced by how easy it is to move from one place to another.  Historically moving by ships over rivers and the ocean was much cheaper than traveling by land.  Communication space really started to become its own space with the development of the telegraph, and exploded with the development of the internet.  Now it is almost as easy to communicate with someone anywhere in the world, as it is to talk with your neighbor.<br /><br />James Bennett says that in general those with an English Heritage, or who are largely influenced by Anglo ideas, are more flexible and will be able to react quicker than European Nations, Japan, China, India, and so on.  They have a greater ability to trust each other, and take initiative on a personal level.  His sees the development of organizations which support each other that transcend national boundaries.  There are a number of libertarian ideas here.<br /><br />If you are into books which explore the big picture and deal with new and fascinating ideas, this is a good book to read.  I don't think everything James Bennett talks about here will happen, but he does provide some interesting insights into what may happen over the next fifty years.  This is not a quick read.

She took her time with this story in developing relationships so that they seemed more reasonable rather than a madly falling in love and sex within days and the entire plot taking place in a week or so. I saw a few Tricks haters reviews, but I found her relationship with her dog not only fun but reasonable considering her backstory. Enough readers have explained the plot so I will just say that as a mystery reader I appreciated the suspense, would have liked to see more tension on that end and think Ms Howard is certainly capable of doing just that, but thoroughly enjoyed the realistic manner in which she allowed her primary characters to gently move together, developing trust and interdependency.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Extreme Thriller!", "text": "Law enforcement authorities in the Cincinnati area are investigating the deaths of four young females murdered by strangulation with a magician's trick rope. A young man with delusions of grandeur fantasizes, practicing and honing his skills in magic, his aspiration to become the next great illusionist. In Chicago, a crazed woman is obsessed with her former pastoral counselor. False accusations and an ensuing scandal require the counselor's family to be placed on sabbatical in the North Woods of Michigan's upper peninsula until the scandal subsides. Caretaker of the grounds at a lighthouse and mansion, the counselor's family experience more than just a sabbatical.<br /><br />Adam Blumer has unmistakably researched his topics and geographic locations down to the most careful details. His presentation is descriptive and dramatic, yet without gory scenes or obscenities, proof that great novels can be penned without sordid, graphic description. Numerous heightened emotions are encountered throughout this fast-paced novel, and overcome through prayer and faith, forgiveness and grace, harmoniously intertwined, creating a calming spiritual quality in the midst of adversity.<br /><br />Fatal Illusions is an impressive, masterfully written suspense story containing multiple plots interwoven into an impressive, heart pounding, and unpredictable experience! This is suspense at its best, thrilling and volatile, undeniably the optimum in suspense in religious fiction. Shocking and unforeseen events come to light throughout this novel, creating a roller coaster ride to the very end.<br /><br />\"Fatal Illusions\" is as good as it gets! Drama unfolds with an ever-increasing pace.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Doesn't understand western riding so she screws up western saddles", "text": "This book was written by someone who doesn't understand western riding, so she screws up in evaluating western saddles. For example, in her section on different types of saddles for cutting, barrel racing, etc, she starts each section with 'the goal of the saddle is to keep her balanced over her feet', then she criticizes the saddle type for not doing this - but her goal is wrong. Cutting, for example, doesn't WANT your feet under you. Neither does reining.<br /><br />She then claims that moving your feet forward puts more weight on the rear of the horse, which defies physics. Moving body parts forward moves weight forward. It doesn't move your center of gravity aft. Nor is a western rider bracing in the saddle, pushing against the cantle when riding like that - he is settled in the deep part of the saddle, legs forward but not rigid and braced. The legs move forward, but the butt stays put - so the balance point moves forward, not aft.<br /><br />Her discussion of endurance saddles suggests an English saddle may be required because the bars on a western endurance saddle may be too short to distribute weight, while ignoring that the saddle works as a whole to distribute weight, and that western saddles distribute it over a much larger area than English - thus less pounds/sq inch. Also, a short Western saddle is usually longer than an English saddle.<br /><br />Her discussion of saddle trees centers on \"Arizona bars\" or \"Northwest bars\" - good luck finding anyone advertising a saddle for sale with \"Arizona bars\". I've never, ever seen a saddle advertised thus. And in discussing flex trees, she seems to miss that flex trees try to modify a stiff piece of plastic to give it the same flex as a tree made from pine & rawhide - thus missing the entire point of flex tree saddles. They restore the flex, not give it new flexibility.<br /><br />Saddle types don't exist independent of equitation. You cannot understand saddle design and fit without also understanding how it is affected by the corresponding style of equitation. FWIW - I ride English, Western and Australian saddles, but I don't ride them as interchangeable. Each has its own corresponding equitation, and riding English style in a Western saddle is as much a mismatch as trying to ride dressage in a jump saddle - you can do it, but you end up fighting the saddle.<br /><br />Saddle designers are not stupid. They design saddles to support the sport and style of riding, and the author of this book doesn't understand that! Her book on English saddle fit is imperfect, but not grossly wrong like this one is.", "images": [], "asin": "1570763895", "parent_asin": "1570763895", "user_id": "AFS3MGFHFCXRJO45SF25OHYAYNYQ", "timestamp": 1302982633000, "helpful_vote": 22, "verified_purchase": true}

He is gifted in rhetoric, and doubtless his book will serve to influence many people and secure funding for his field. This is unfortunate, because his field is most accurately described as scientific materialism and neo-social Darwinism.<br />Consilience, Mr. Wilson tells us, is the realistic march toward the \"unification of knowledge.\" He laments that science has spread into so many disciplines and the average scientist is highly specialized. Now it occurs to me (from my own study of mathematics, electrical engineering and observation of others) that this is entirely necessary because the scope of human knowledge has long since passed that which can be achieved by an individual mind. Not only did Mr. Wilson fail to mention this, but he goes on to talk about highly technical scientific areas (neuroscience, chaos mathematical theory, particle physics to name a few) outside of his specialty of biology in a manner that didn't convey a scrap of humility.  It could be that he possesses extreme genius, but I think it more likely that he understands only a tiny fraction of those other fields. That said, he has picked out parts of those other specialty areas that support his view of scientific materialism. I am confident, given this philosophy, that Mr. Wilson would resurrect Eugenics via genetic manipulation to create a posthuman/transhuman capable of the kind of genius required for \"Consilience.\"  Despite the logical and historical link between Darwinism and Eugenics, Wilson remains largely silent about this. I think this is because human cloning and genetically engineered \"people\" are highly unpopular, and his book needs to attract people (and funding) to his ideas. Perhaps this is why he has chosen the more popular issues of global warming and overpopulation as his final call to arms, despite the fact that they don't seem compatible with scientific materialism and neo-social Darwinism.<br />The reason I think they are incompatible is this.  These philosophies hold that were are nothing more than a complex (biological) machine that was formed by millions of years of ruthless competition with and defeat of rival species. This view provides no motivation to deal with the very real problem of evil. It very much tends toward the nihilistic clich\u00e9 \"there is no good or evil, only power and those strong enough to seize it,\" which is as least as old as the Thrasymachus, Glaucon, and Socrates dialogue in Plato's Republic. If you do not admire this ethic, you may want to examine the competing view (beyond the straw man argument \"The Transcendentalist\" Wilson puts up on page 264 of my edition of Consilience).  This is what I have done, and I am now a Christian.<br />Wilson relies heavily on rhetoric against Christianity in his assertion for scientific materialism. Consider where he compares the Christian annunciation and resurrection to drug based hallucinations (pages 77-80), or when he compares adherence to religious authority to a cringing, whining submission to a snarling alpha wolf or monkey (pg 283). It is an obvious appeal to competitive pride (who wants to be thought of as a sniveling, fearful dominated animal?) later cemented by a hypothetical visit from extraterrestrials who conclude we only recently evolved from nonhuman primates (we can't let them think we're that far BEHIND, can we?). He gets his nastiest on page 268: where he links the Christian rejection of sin and belief in an afterlife with cruelty, genocide, environmental exploitation and suicidal martyrdom.  He then slips in a fuzzy statistic (a subject I do no something about) to claim that almost all scientists are atheists or agnostics-Mark Twain must have rolled over in his grave. He makes full use of other widespread cultural myths: the Newton apple story (pg 32), the Galileo flap (pg 35), the battle of Science & Reason, and of course the one which his whole book is based-the universal scientific acceptance of \"survival of the fittest\" (pg 180) Darwinism. You will not find the likes of Fred Hoyle, Arthur Peacock, Michael Denton, or Michael Behe mentioned in Consilience.  Readers of Consilience should be reminded that evolution is not incompatible with theism.  \"Survival of the fittest\" Darwinism, by contrast, employs the philosophy of hell-that creatures lives only at the expense of others, mostly by killing them.  It seems to ignore or distort things like symbiosis, or the cooperation of cells in an organism.<br />Before making up your mind about Mr. Wilson's claims, I recommend examining the following links:<br />On the scientific debates surrounding evolution theory, especially the mechanism of natural selection:", "images": [], "asin": "067976867X", "parent_asin": "067976867X", "user_id": "AHCFGH6KTKB526EOEWTCWLY7GWJA", "timestamp": 1035215005000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}

Her protagonist, Penny, eloped at age 17 with Trent, who worked for Penny's father.  Throughout the book, Trent's abuse of Penny and Penny's acceptance of it reads very real.  Penny's friends, Callie Mae and Fatimah both try numerous times to help her, but Penny waffles between staying with Trent and leaving him.  Her pregnancy compounds the issue:  she doesn't want her baby to be hurt, but she does want her baby to have a father.<br /><br />Homes does a great job keeping the reader interested to the end to find out what exactly will happen with Penny and Trent.  Will his abuse escalate to the point of resulting in death?  Will he change?  Will they stay together?  Will Penny leave him?<br /><br />There were some problem areas, though, throughout the story:<br /><br />The book starts off as a letter to Penny's son Manny, explaining to him about his father and their situation.  At first, I liked the idea, but after a while, all of the insertions of \"Manny\" into the text was distracting.<br /><br />Penny elopes with Trent at age 17, after only a week of being \"his woman\".<br />Penny and Trent attend church at one point, but then it is never spoken about again until much later.  It seems to the reader that they hadn't gone back, but when it is mentioned that second time, it is explained that they had been going all those months.<br />While Trent's abusive behavior is not condoned, and characters say that Penny is not Trent's property, some of the other thoughts in the book stick to the idea that the man is in charge (the head) of his household and must take care of his wife.  While Penny & Trent's relationship is contrasted negatively with Fatimah and Edgard's good relationship, the image in both of them is that the man is in charge.<br /><br />When Penny finally sees her parents again, her father seems to be a different kind of person than described earlier on in the book.  I think the author could have explored the family histories of both Trent and Penny more, to show how their pasts helped to shape who they were.<br />The symbol in the book of the statue with wings of glass was beautiful, and aptly described Penny.  Fatimah and Callie Mae's friendships with Penny are wonderful, and Fatimah and Penny's is full of hurt and forgiveness both; it's a beautiful friendship.<br /><br />Overall, the book was ok.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Winter Baloney", "text": "Oh my.  Where to start?  How does one even begin to start talking about this big, sprawling, gigantic mess of a novel?  Mr. Helprin's ambitions were enormous.  He wasn't trying to write the great American novel, oh no, not him.  Instead, he had to write the Greatest Novel in the History of the World.  That he tried, I suppose, is commendable.  But unfortunately, he failed, and abysmally so.<br /><br />The shortest way to describe the novel is that it is a fantasy story about New York City. It takes place in the 19th, then 20th, and finally the 21st century, but don't let that fool you.  Helprin's New York isn't really recognizable in any era, and for that matter, may as well take place in an alternate universe.  But that's okay.  We know it's a fantasy;  we understand that this is the form that he has chosen to use.<br /><br />The problem is that, in the early going at least, he doesn't give us anything to latch on to.  The first third of the book is a terrible struggle to get through because there is absolutely nothing with which the reader can identify.  Horses jump three then four then five city blocks.  Orphans are valued because they are used by their overseers to make fabulous amounts of money for themselves.  People with fever sleep outside in the bitter cold to assuage attacks.  New Jersey is a swamp, inhabited by the \"Baymen,\" who are great swordsmen, and love to drink purple \"clam beer.\"  There are dangerous gangs in the city known as the Short Tails and the Dead Rabbits.  One group of Short Tails, known as the woolah woolah boys, jump from third-story buildings in front of delivery trucks, and bounce up and down in front of them using springs attached to their feet.  They shout \"woolah woolah\" at the drivers of the truck, who are so distracted they don't notice the rest of the Short Tails stealing from the back of their truck.  All of this is very clever, ha ha, but what the heck is going on?<br /><br />About two hundred pages into it the story shoots ahead about a hundred years, and at this point becomes a little easier to follow, at least to the extent that we know it is 1995.  But the zaniness picks up pretty quickly again, and we're back on the rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Mr. Helprin is very gifted with words, and his descriptions are often very evocative.  Frozen lakes, the moon rising over a snowy landscape, horses pulling sleighs on frozen rivers, mist coming through the cold towers of the silent city;  all are wonderfully portrayed.  But he is too ambitious and much too much of this is overdone.  Nobody's eyes are blue, no, they must be \"blue as the wet blue cups in a palette of watercolors.\"  Nobody is just big, they are so big that their pocket-watch is \"as big as a clock, but which, in his large hand, did not seem so.\"  Nobody can have black hair, oh no.  It must be, \"as glistening as the thick pelt of a healthy seal.\"  A gangster's eyes are \"like razors and diamonds.\"  Now I understand that there are people in fiction who are simply larger than life and must be conveyed that way, and again, his creative descriptions are often illuminative, but when every single person, place, animal or thing is described in such overwrought terms, one's credibility starts to become strained.  A little of this goes a long way.<br /><br />And he's a little lazy too.  The fantastic nature of the story allows him to take too many shortcuts.  Peter Lake, a central character, fixes a printing press thusly:  \"You see this oscillating slotted bar that's rubbing up too close to the powl and ratchet of this here elliptic trammel?\"  Apparently, it \"distorts the impact load on the second hobbing.\"  Of course.  These aren't real parts, they are fantasy parts, but how convenient that Mr. Helprin doesn't have to do even the slightest research into how a printing press works.<br /><br />And this is a symptom of the ultimate failing of the book, which is that this fantasy carries over into the characters also, not one of whom comes across as a believable human being.  All are one-dimensional, fairy-tale characters, with only the most absurdly drawn characteristics to distinguish them from one another.  It almost seems that he intended it this way.  Here are some of their names:  Overweary, Mootfowl, Humpstone John, Boisy D'Anglais, Marko Chestnut, Craig Binky.  Binky is very wealthy.  You want to take a wild stab in the dark as to whether Binky is a likable character or not?<br /><br />The two central romances are grossly idealized.  Beverly realizes that Peter loves her, \"in exactly the way she loved everything that she knew she would lose.\"  This is their first meeting.  How touching.  Hardesty and Virginia had, \"fallen in love in the obsessive and total way of two people who have seen the same truth which they cannot quite comprehend.\"  This is their first meeting.  How quaint.  Beverly dies, though, shortly after, and Hardesty and Virginia's domestic life pretty much disappears.  Again, how convenient that Mr. Helprin gets to dodge the rather mundane chore of showing them changing diapers, or fretting over the mortgage payment, or coming home late.<br /><br />But, really, this isn't the point, is it?  No, the point of this novel seems to be nothing more than to give Mr. Helprin a forum wherin he can express his admittedly interesting views about life, politics, ambition, beauty, and philosophy.  Some of this is very good, and in the end, uplifting.  The smaller stories running throughout this can be funny as well.  Hardesty's adventure with Jesse Honey was a scream, as was Binky's argument with the computer.  There are also many little clever lines throughout, such as the comment about the noisemaking class in the garbageman's school.<br /><br />But as a novel it doesn't work.  All of the clever ideas and unusual descriptions--and the hopeful ending--are nothing more than decorations.  Frosting on a stale cake, if you will.  A leather saddle on a dead horse.", "images": [], "asin": "0151972036", "parent_asin": "0151972036", "user_id": "AHJ2EGNNLVEMJA6MTCLFWWDY6QMQ", "timestamp": 971637504000, "helpful_vote": 50, "verified_purchase": false}

It is entitled, &quot;The Brown Wasps,&quot; and if you've never read anything by Eisley, you might want to start there.  Among many things, this particular essay is about memory, home, and the place of death in life - themes that run throughout the book whose essays are intimate narratives that intermingle meditations on science and personal history.  Having now written these words I feel they miss the mark in recommending this book becuase the themes of Eisley's work seem more experiential than concrete to me, which is the case for many truths about life - truths that can be captured more by the feelings evoked by a time and a place than by mere words alone.  And yet, his words do a remarkable job of evoking past times and places, locating them in your present life and providing a context for understanding their meaning.  If you read this book, perhaps you'll want to share it with a friend, as my friend did with me, and I have with many good friends since.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Where Loyalties Lie is piratical grimdark mastery, superbly written, with utterly engaging characters", "text": "Where Loyalties Lie is the first book in The Best Laid Plans duology and will be followed up by The Fifth Empire of Man shortly. I think many fantasy readers will wish to read this based on the next two words: grimdark pirates! The two main characters in this pirate-tastic tale are the legendary Captains' Drake Morrass, who's only out for himself, and Keelin Stillwater, the best swordsman within the pirate isles. The two become unlikely allies as a larger threat beckons. The Empire is burning cities, killing women and children, and are essentially looking to eradicate piracy and all involved whilst manning the largest and greatest warships ever seen. The pirates need to unite or they are finished.<br /><br />Instead of Point of View perspective, this narrative is presented as Point of Ship perspective, following numerous individuals who frequent the different vessels. This is a really interesting take on character presentation, doesn't get confusing, and led to a quality and deepness to the main players of which there are about 12. Grimdark is normally littered with 'bastards you love to hate,' for the majority, I don't think that assumption fits here. There are a few utterly evil characters sure, but I think in an environment where rape, murder, and robbery are the norms, that the World is the real bastard here and even the cut-throat pirates do what they do just to survive and they have elements of goodness, ambitions, and hopes. I clearly saw how some of the characters developed and almost became better people due to new comradeship and the ever looming threats. The way it's superbly well written, I truly felt like I knew the characters after a chapter or two, and when I finished the book I kept thinking about them. Thinking about what had happened, their often notorious pasts which were generally just hinted at, and what could possibly happen next. I would recommend taking a few notes regarding characters so you can remember which ships characters like Princess, Feather, Keelin, and Yanic are on.<br /><br />This story includes Treasure Island-esque elements such as pirates loving rum, ships hierarchies, and one Captain even has a parrot. These things never feel forced or cliche and suit the world expertly. This book has some dark scene so be warned, especially a rape scene that happens early on to a likable character. One of the reasons I like grimdark is that no-ones safe and literally, anything could happen in those scenes. The sea battles were exquisite, as were the characters relationships - past and present. As stated, it's a dark environment but the narrative is littered with humour which sometimes keeps things light in the face of terror. The World seems typical but well-created fantasy. I believe this is set in the same world as and follows the events of The Ties that Bind. It has numerous religions, magics, and monsters. There may be some nuggets here a fan of his previous trilogy would recognise however, this duology is a complete standalone. In similar fashion, this book needs paying attention to. I don't think anything that was written here is coincidental and will, therefore, relate to upcoming drama, showdowns, or past revelations. Although we get to know the characters relatively well they are still mysterious and make future reveals and future engagements an intensely exciting prospect. Where Loyalties Lie is written and edited brilliantly. The ending has 2 or 3 action-packed climactic scenes which were great. It's completely self-contained but maybe at the finale, the sides are set for what I hope will be a breathtaking conclusion. I requested the ARC of book 2 off Rob about 10-minutes after I finished this one which I guess speaks volumes on how engrossing and enjoyable this story was. Where Loyalties Lie is piratical grimdark mastery, superbly written, with utterly engaging characters, and is a true contender for this years #SPFBO.", "images": [], "asin": "1545581924", "parent_asin": "1545581924", "user_id": "AFP5LFXUW3TZ4PZPIZFOCHM44ANQ", "timestamp": 1514187259988, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fresh and exciting. Loved it!", "text": "If you think you the story of Robin Hood has been done so many times, there can't be anything new about it, think again. A.C. Gaughen writes a story that's fresh, exciting and romantic and puts a new spin and the story you thought you knew!<br /><br />Scarlet in set in Nottinghamshire, a small town ruled over by the evil and corrupt sheriff who oppresses the people beyond the breaking point. Robin is a nobleman who has had his title, lands and possessions unjustly taken from him. Of course, he loves his people so he steals for them so they can eat and pay their taxes and break them out of the jail when they are locked up. Everything is going as well as usual until the sheriff hires a new thief taker, one that even has the unflappable Will Scarlet terrified.<br /><br />The story is told from Scarlet's perspective, and she is the best and most daring thief in Robin Hood's band. Very few people know that Scarlet is actually a girl, one with a chip on her shoulder and a shadowy past. The boys, Robin, Little John and Much, know what she is and are fiercely protective of Scarlet who hates being fussed over and treated differently.<br /><br />The first thing you notice when you start reading the book is Scarlet's dialect and since the book is told from her first person perspective, it's constant throughout the book. It took me about two pages to get used to it and it seemed so natural after that.<br /><br />I loved Scarlet! She had so much emotional baggage and a past that was a complete mystery, but it was slowly revealed throughout the book. The pain and angst the character feels is very well written. The fact that she is deadly with the knives made me love her that much more.<br /><br />There is a of a love triangle of sorts among Scarlet, Little John and Robin. Robin is gallant, swoon worthy and utterly frustrating! He jealously accuses Scarlet of sending John mixed signals when he pretty much guilty of doing the same thing to her. Regardless, I liked Robin a lot and raced through the book to see how the romance would play out.<br /><br />Scarlet is a fast paced, exciting book with some awesome plot twists thrown in and I loved it. Gaughen has written a solid debut novel that left me wanting more. I have no idea if there will be a sequel as the book works well as a standalone novel, but I would love to go back to this world.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Strong message, disappointing writing", "text": "When the Haboob Sings had potential. I picked it up because I was curious about the issues explored, and I was not disappointed on that front. The novel addresses censorship, equality and religious freedom through a lens I\u2019d not normally experience, and the ultimate message is universal.<br /><br />The novel was immersive in terms of culture. I can\u2019t say for certain if it was accurate, but it didn\u2019t waver from its central point of reference and in that way the representation and resulting plot felt believable.The story also did a good job capturing the family dynamics and rendering each character as an individual. I was hungry for some concrete factual details regarding place, but I understand why those were left out.<br /><br />However, the writing style was not engaging. One of the main reasons I read literary fiction \u2014 aside from message or perspective \u2014 is for the imagery and powerful symbolism. That was not present in this novel, and in fact, most of the narration felt like a simple stating of events. More than once I found myself asking \u201cWhy is this explained and not dialogue? Why isn\u2019t this a full scene?\u201d The author lacked trust that I could connect to the more subtle aspects of the story, and so largely didn\u2019t include any.<br /><br />At one point the main character makes a comment that they are not observant of their surroundings and so won\u2019t describe them too much to the reader. This felt less like a clever writing choice and more like a cop-out. I can understand using this to get away with sparse description, but even with that there wasn\u2019t enough. Imagery is what pulls me down into a story and allows the tension to grow in quiet ways. Without it the pacing felt off, the story stilted, and I wasn\u2019t captivated.<br /><br />I will say, though, that in the very last few chapters the story started to pick up a little more for me. My curiosity was piqued, and I was paying attention. The ending, while not evoking a strong emotional response, felt appropriate. There were little sparks of prose here and throughout that continued to tease the potential I could see. If it had been more, if it had touched me in a strong emotional way, it would have been more compelling and memorable.<br /><br />In the end, I didn\u2019t really enjoy reading this book. I wanted to, very much, but I was bored and unattached from the characters and events. For those who prefer straightforward books, are wanting a different twist on a censorship narrative, or who would like to read more books set in Muslin cultures, this might be worth some time. But even then I can\u2019t help but feel there are books that can do the same thing and more.", "images": [], "asin": "B07SHXBCDN", "parent_asin": "B07SHXBCDN", "user_id": "AGSLMV6VE6IB6VF4NL4CSMN6NSVA", "timestamp": 1567689545172, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Mixed Messages left me utterly confused!", "text": "I requested a copy of this book to review because I was attracted to its concept, which, in a nutshell, is that changing your perspective on your past, and your circumstances in the present can change your life for the better.  While I believe this to be true, I felt that Silvious fell far short of doing a good job explaining this in her book.<br />I was attracted to the idea of reading the stories of various Biblical women, and discovering how their stories relate to the ideas presented in each chapter, but I didn't quite understand some of the connections Silvious made between the two, nor how the stories supported her conclusions.  I often ended each chapter feeling as though I must have missed something.  Some of the stories of modern women she interjects throughout each chapter seem to relate much better to her concepts, but she hops back and forth between the Bible stories and the modern day stories so much that it just felt disjointed.<br />In Same Life, new Story, Silvious likens our lives to stories, wherein some of the pages are filled up, but \"there are always new blank pages on which to write. \"  Therefore, we can always \"start over\", but doing so \"most often comes with a new perspective and a new way of thinking.\"<br />I agree with this idea, and Silvious does explain (albeit to a small extent) how different mindsets, attitudes, and beliefs can hold us back and keep us stuck in a story(life circumstance) with which we aren't happy.  But I found there to be a number of serious mixed messages throughout the book that left me utterly confused.  For example, Silvious states that \"how you write your story is up to you\", and \"The story is yours to create, and it is yours to tell.\"  But later she states, \"You are not the author of this story.  God is.\", and \"He knows you didn't volunteer to be a character in this story, but (...) you have been chosen to live this story\", and \"God is the author who writes our stories.\"  So which is it?  This was the most confusing thing about the book for me.<br />In one chapter, Silvious tells us that we must learn to be content in our circumstances, and in another, she implores us to \"choose instead\" rather than \"accept the status quo\" when we are dissatisfied with our current situation.<br />Silvious also tells us in one chapter that whining about our troubles is because \"it is hard for us to bow to the fact that an unseen hand holds our lives, and whether good or bad is happening, He is in control of it all\", then later scolds us for \"blaming God for your troubles.\" (This is connected to the \"who writes our stories and who doesn't\" question!)<br />Silvious tells us on one hand that \"No one but you can propel your story forward\", then on the other hand, she says \"In the midst of your story, God propels you to a new future.\"<br />If there is any way to reconcile these contradictory statements, she does not explain them.<br />For most of the questions at the end of each chapter given for personal reflection and group study, I had no idea how I would answer them, and because of the mixed messages, I wasn't inclined to even try.<br />I agree with other reviewers who felt this book couldn't rightly be called a Bible study.  And again, although I did enjoy reading the Biblical accounts, I could not make the connection with them as they were supposed to relate to the chapter, so to me they just seemed incidental.<br />I love the concept of the book, but I don't think Silvious quite pulled it off.  There are plenty of other books regarding changing your perspective that would be worth your money far more than Same Life, New Story.<br />I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "0785228195", "parent_asin": "0785228195", "user_id": "AGQQ4SHWV6TGFAPRDFWSGZSKTNPQ", "timestamp": 1297701175000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Subtle, haunting, and prolific", "text": "What is a Dirge?  It is a lingering sense of supernatural, the mystical, and mixed with a bevy of fear and excitement, seen in only half exposure.  A Dirge for the Temporal encompasses these meanings and treats us to a blend of subtle temptation and brutal beauty.  Thirty-four stories take us through a poignant mind's eye of gifted author Darren Speegle.<br /><br />Forget formulas here, it is a time travel of past, present, and future, fused in a collection, where you have to question whether you are the character or the reader.  While I wouldn't mind telling you a little about each story, I think it best to let you go on your own journey.  From this vast collection, I will recount the ones that most intrigued me.<br /><br />I drifted in and out with \"September\", caught up in the subtle references to name and places.  It has a unique voice and rhythm to read by. The context of the story is like a puzzle, and once put together leaves you in awe.<br /><br />\"Illusions of Amber\" had me engrossed.  It's a story to pay attention to and yet become lost in.  A sense of strange inhabits the desolate town of Amber, Indiana, but is it safe to stay in Room One at the Traveler's Lodge?<br /><br />\"The Smell of Sex\" is like an ethereal moment where it would appear time has stopped.  It caresses you in, with incredible character development, and imagery, only to leave you cold and wanting more.<br /><br />To read the story \"A Dirge for the Temporal\" is to be caught in the middle of a dream and a nightmare.  The author's voice speaks in languid motions, bringing you in, taunting you close, and then drifting away for you to decide what you come away with.  It's hauntingly sweet and yet disturbing.<br /><br />In a \"Nasty Set of Circumstances\", the character feels the girl he is seeing is sucking the life out of him.  He believes she keeps him in a perpetual state of apprehension, and questions who holds the power in the relationship.  If he had the opportunity, what would he do to change it?<br /><br />\"The Day it Rained Apricots\" left me with a smile.  It is a blend of mood and tone; mixed with history and visual bliss.  A competition among bakers in a small village in Bavaria, serves up an interesting twist.<br /><br />\"Junkyard Fetish\" is a hardcore, bloodthirsty tale that is one of my absolute favorites.  I loved the dialogue, the flow of the story, the characters, and the element of \"the game\".<br /><br />\"Mousse\" reminds me of a smooth tawny port at the end of the day, it definitely tastes like another.<br /><br />And finally \"Dandelion Girl\" rounds out my favorites, for its sweet, sentimental, and subtle descent into questioning the nature of evil. Appearances can be deceiving, and leave a bittersweet taste in the air.  I liked the whimsical poetic path it took me on and the feeling I was left with in the end.<br /><br />Atmosphere and imagery run amok in these stories.  You don't just read about the places, you experience them, the people, and the entities that inhabit them. Daren Speegle has the ability to capture your soul, and slowly release it back to you, with merely a few scars. It's more than worth the read, it's worth the euphoria your mind senses when you've turned the last page.", "images": [], "asin": "0974503134", "parent_asin": "0974503134", "user_id": "AEHMO6CMVGSXAD7ADCJHAGAU3N4A", "timestamp": 1091021343000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

I've read Maddox's website for years, and have long respected him for not giving in to the temptation to make money from his site with pop-ups, banners, etc.  My sole purpose for having purchased this book was to support him financially for the years of entertainment he has provided millions for free.<br /><br />Then the book arrived...  While still in the box from Amazon, the woman that delivered it grew a full beard and back hair just in the time it took her to carry it to my doorstep.  By the time I got to page three, my testicles had stretch marks.  At this point, I was afraid, and would have put the book down except that I knew doing so would have instantly reduced me to a sniveling girly-boy.  By the time I finished the book, I had grown 8 inches, and not taller.<br /><br />I was once a computer programmer that spent my days in a cubicle.  After reading the book, I walked into my place of work (I didn't even use the door, just walked through the brick wall) and smashed many faces and headbutted many a uterus, and am now the CEO of the company.  I don't even work anymore.  I just told them I was CEO, and nobody had enough testosterone to say otherwise.<br /><br />This book will change your life.  Merely looking at the book in person will cause hair growth in places you didn't know hair could grow.  Actually opening it will saturate you with testosterone.  It is not recommended that you allow your wife near the book, as the book itself will have its way with her.<br /><br />This is my third copy I'm buying today.

All sacrifices are sham sacrifices. Material is only one of the imbalances on the chess board (read Jeremy Silman's book). So the sacrifice we usually refer to is about material.

Who's accidentally acquired a soccer-mad private army of child soldiers? What happened at the Glue Factory? Who forgot to switch off the fountains? Oh, and by the way... Why is Africa's richest country so poor? A deceptive plot to take over the 'richest country in Africa' in the name of Democracy. An ethically-challenged businessman on a voyage of self-discovery. A glimpse into the dark heart of the 'New Democratic Consensus'.  Who thinks running guns to Africa could be a nice little earner? Who\u2019s accidentally acquired a soccer-mad private army of child soldiers? Who forgot to switch off the fountains? Oh, and by the way\u2026 why is Africa\u2019s richest country\u2026. So poor?<br /><br />Review: Really good book and it was easy to get into and l highly recommended this book to anybody and I was sent this book for review and l would tell people that you should step outside your comfort zone with books because it's good to add more authors and genres to your reading portfolio even if you don't read books like this and it was a real enjoyable storyline.<br /><br />About the author: I've always been interested in literature and politics. I studied English Literature at Oxford University at a very political time - the early years of the Thatcher era. Later on, living and working in the US for eight years (North Carolina, Boston, Wall Street), I acquired a lasting fascination with American politics. (And a wife, too.) My books are political thrillers with a comic or satirical edge. They take a sceptical look at what American and British political ideas mean for the world at large. The Regime Change Man' is slightly futuristic. It's about 'regime change' in an oil-rich African country. But is it really all about oil? Well, maybe not. The hero is a wealthy but ethically-challenged businessman, Alan Michael Vickery. He's self-made. He's fought his way up. He's made enemies. And now he wants to advance his interests by getting into politics.<br />A big mistake. You might not like him much when you first meet him. But, by the end, you may just have changed your opinion.<br />'The Populist' is a contemporary political thriller with rather more of a comic and satirical slant. It's about what happens when an ordinary everyman gets swept up into high politics, and gets a one-time-only chance to make his mark. The hero is John Dolt - and heroes don't get much more ordinary. Will he be able to resolve the Greater Persian Question? There are sinister forces out there that would like to. And not in the nicest way, either.<br />Meanwhile, England is wracked by 'disturbances', and the Prime Minister is desperate. Can John Dolt bring peace in our time? And at what price? 'The Plutocrat' is also a political thriller, largely US-based, and set in the near future. There's also a satirical edge to this book, but it's darker. It's less overtly comic than the 'The R\u00e9gime change Man' or 'The Populist'. It's about what happens when people give up on their familiar political leaders and parties, and put their faith in a third-party candidate for President. In this story, he's called Willard Prince and he runs an exclusive hedge fund. He's incredibly successful and stupendously rich. Financial insiders believe that he has an 'edge'. But do the voters really know what they'd be getting? Who could stop him? The homeless woman who joins his campaign? The slacker-girl who gets mixed up with the Robin Hood Party? The Australian whistle-blower guy, who's on the run? And what if - as many people seem to fear - China has 'surpassed' America already?<br />The books all make use of interesting locations around the world - sometimes exotic ones. They're mostly places I've actuall visited. The action may take place in Africa, or Central America, or Australia, as well as in London or New York. The books may occasionally make fun of the James Bond-style spy novel, but those exciting locations are one of the things I enjoy in Ian Fleming's books. Most of all, though, I hope these books deliver solid entertainment value. That was certainly my intention.<br /><br />Edition: kindle, hardback and paperback<br /><br />Star rating:  5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />.", "images": [], "asin": "1910665029", "parent_asin": "1910665029", "user_id": "AFDKSTSAGMFDLEJFKJ77Y3T5E2IA", "timestamp": 1442596357000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I highly recommend listening AND reading along with this amazing story. The full cast of narrators continues to make this an even more rich setting than it already was on the written page.<br /><br />What a delightful end to this wonderful trilogy. Endings are tough for me to stomach, which says more about me than it does anything else. I adored the first two books in this trilogy and I was struggling to say goodbye to the characters that I loved so much. It was, however, a phenomenal ending despite the tinge of bittersweet. My rule of thumb is that a book gets five stars if it makes me FEEL things and this made me feel all kinds of things.  I cried. I gasped aloud. I got angry. I laughed.<br /><br />I would be shocked if anyone who loved the first two did not adore this one. The storytelling and world-building continue to be excellently crafted and our beloved characters grow and bond with one another in wonderful ways. And while endings are difficult, this was worth the anxiety of saying goodbye (for now). I will absolutely be adding this trilogy to my shelves so that I can reread it over and over.<br /><br />Thank you Andrea Stewart for giving us this wonderful world and these complex characters.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "a very strict diet for body and soul", "text": "This oddly disturbing book triggered the macrobiotic revolution in the sixties.  In fairness to the author, it is a translation, purportedly from Japanese to French to English.<br /><br />Sanpaku describes a condition where the iris of the eye is surrounded on three sides by the white of the eye.  This is a predicator of disease and disaster.  Everything from the assassination of JFK to the death of Natalie Wood to virtually every disease known to man is attributable to this sanpaku. The author has already predicted the downfall of the United States due to the poor health of Americans. Disaster can, however, be averted by following a strict macrobiotic regimen. The diet is highly restrictive and includes grains, a few vegetables, tea and occasional fruit.  Water and fluids are restricted and animal proteins and dairy are eschewed.<br /><br />There are some valid points presented.  The introduction of processed foods, pollution, use of drugs, pesticides and toxins and corporate farming has compromised the food supply. People have moved away from eating when actually hungry and drinking when actually thirsty.  Whether a strict macrobiotic diet is the answer is debatable.<br /><br />Even making allowances for date of the material, this book forwards some troubling ideas.  The author appears to think that women should be limited to child bearing and being beautiful.  According to the author, there is nothing more pitiable than a single woman or a homosexual.  Women with hair on their arms are too yang, truly an abomination.  (Interestingly, while distinguishing the ideal woman as yin and the man as yang, the diet is the same for both.)<br /><br />The introduction by the translator is too long (over fifty pages).  It relates his story and the success he enjoyed while following the diet. The tone of the book is both fatalistic and unquestioning. So while the book presents some interesting ideas, I would be cautious about following it hook, line and sinker.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Dark Absorbing Thriller", "text": "4 AND 1/2 STARS.<br /><br />Shadow Season is another brilliant novel by suspense and thriller author Tom Piccirilli.  The insight and depth in which he writes about his characters are so raw that, at times, it is painful to read (in a good way, of course).  I am constantly blown away by his poetic prose and the layers of psychology he uses to flesh out his characters.<br /><br />While I became a fan of Piccirilli from his days writing horror, I've grown to appreciate his versatility as a writer of thrillers and crime fiction, particularly the crime noir genre.  This guy has it down perfectly and you wonder at times who exactly he hangs around to get details this authentic.  He's just that good.<br /><br />Although nearly perfect, I thought Shadow Season had just a bit too much emphasis devoted to characterization and the lead character's inner thoughts and not enough on story and plot.  Those elements of the book were not as nicely balanced as in some of the author's other stories, but that's a minor gripe.  A 9.5 out of 10 is certainly nothing frown upon.<br /><br />It is clear through his writing that Piccirilli is heads and tails better than 98% of other writers in the same genre.  He is one of the few authors I read that consistently produce top levels of breathtaking fiction every time out.  His distinct voice is like no one I've ever read.  Like a scene from a Scorsese movie, you can read one paragraph from a Piccirilli novel and know exactly who wrote it.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The Borgias", "text": "When reading any piece of history that is previously unfamiliar to me, I am always left wondering what is true and what isn't. But as they say history is written by the victors so I guess in the long run, the Borgias must have been the losers because their name has been adequately sullied over the years. They have been implicated in sex scandals, illegitimate children, incest and corruption on a level that would rival many of today's mafia families.<br /><br />According to this author, the Borgias were no different from any rich, powerful families of that era. Yes, they were ruthless and would resort to extreme ends to get their way but the author argues that they were in no way much different from other such powerful families of the time. Perhaps some of the resentment towards them stemmed from their successes and their almost exclusive devotion to family above all else. This author believes that their rivals then concocted outlandish stories to sully the Borgia name as the final revenge. The author also lays some of the blame for the lurid tales at the feet of the emerging protestant powers who loved nothing better than to point fingers at what they saw as a corrupt institution, the catholic church.<br /><br />Despite my ignorance on the Borgias, I was struck by Meyers attempt to use the exact same tactics used by those he claims defame the Borgias. He uses an almost universal brush to paint Borgia detractors as evil. As I stated earlier, since I do no know much about this era, I can't attest to the truth of those statements. It just struck me that he was willing to absolve the Borgias of almost every accusation while believing the worst of their critics.<br /><br />All in all, I did like this book. I did find it to be somewhat overwhelming at times and dense but it is a historical book and that is to be expected.", "images": [], "asin": "0345526910", "parent_asin": "0345526910", "user_id": "AH4QFHRFFRQYLZSBK47NQDMDSAHQ", "timestamp": 1368661659000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

This Lovecraftian realm will be a frequent source of tension in the books.  Also, though he won't return in later books, Archancellor Weatherwax will be mentioned in Lords and Ladies, and the school he oversees, Unseen University, school of wizardry and frequent setting for the novels, makes its first true appearance in this book.<br /><br />Review and Summary: This books hangs together slightly better than the first Discworld novel, The Color of Magic, and picks up immediately where that novel dropped off.  (Literally - when we left Rincewind and Twoflower, they were on their way over the edge of the world.)  This story adds a driving narrative, dispensing with much of the episodic nature of the first book.<br /><br />Along the way, the two meet up with Cohen the Barbarian, meet trolls, fight wizards, threaten book-burners, and possibly save the Discworld from annihilation.<br /><br />Since the story is much more of a narrative, more of the humor comes from the story, and not just from the setup.  Therefore, this book is a bit funnier than Color of Magic, but also sticks with you a bit more.<br /><br />I wouldn't start with this book if you haven't read any Discworld books yet, but if you're reading through the series as a completist, you should enjoy this one.", "images": [], "asin": "0060855886", "parent_asin": "0060855886", "user_id": "AE3VEC6OS2ISA4HAR5TU3GFW73BQ", "timestamp": 1358217795000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I carry a long history of rejection and unworthiness rooted in childhood sexual abuse. While God has brought monumental healing and freedom in those broken places, the remnants of unworthiness and rejection still plague my fragile heart from time to time. As I began reading Mary's book, healing truths about God's love and acceptance of me washed over my heart. These are not one time truths either.  As people living in a world that constantly measures and challenges our worth against the various facets Mary walks us through in her book, we desperately need encouraging words to remind us of His unfailing approval of us every single day. In this book, Mary is so intentional to not throw Christian clich\u00e9s or scriptural quips at us but instead walks with us on a journey to settling our worth in Jesus once and for all. This is a journey she is well acquainted with, having struggled with her own worth as well. That is what makes this book so fresh and so real. She is transparent about her struggles in this area with real life examples that make you gasp and exclaim &#34;That happened to you too?&#34; or &#34;Wow I'm not crazy after all!&#34; Although every chapter has had a profound impact on me with groundbreaking truths such as I am loved, secure, beautiful, accepted, approved of; & I am more than my career, the money I earn, the actions of my children & the things I accomplish; the chapter that traveled to the core of my soul was Chapter 8; I Am Chosen.  Like Mary, I too have longed to be chosen by others. I have often felt like the donkey in Shrek, jumping up and down while screaming &#34;Pick me! Pick me!&#34; Her words in this chapter brought some sense of peaceful normalcy to this need given we have similar histories. Her affirmations that we are chosen by God, the Only One Who matters; brought clarity, perspective, & a resounding hallelujah that I can rest in Him no matter who chooses me on earth.  I also found it profound that in order to combat feelings of not being chosen, we should be intentional about choosing others. This creates a healthy distraction from focusing on ourselves to focusing on those that have been forgotten. I cannot emphasize how this chapter and really the entire book transformed my thinking in so many ways that I will return to it over and over again to gain strength and receive encouragement. If you are looking for words that will embalm your unworthiness wounds, dress them with healing truth, and nurse them to full recovery with practical advice; Worth Living is definitely the book for you.", "images": [], "asin": "080100585X", "parent_asin": "080100585X", "user_id": "AHNUXTQAKZWVX6SQKTZH3FFRH5VA", "timestamp": 1462304937000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A fascinating premise, clever protagonist and twisty ending", "text": "Having written many book reviews, I have to admit this one is not an easy one to summarize or even describe. After the first 20 or so pages, I thought I would not become \"invested\" in a character who was never remembered. By anyone. How would she develop relationships? Her memories would be small, shallow I thought. What kind of experiences would be interesting enough without strong relationships? I wondered. I kept reading and I found out.<br /><br />V.E. Schwab, best known for her fantasy novels and YA fiction, crafted Adeline (Addie) LaRue with the skill of an artist. And relationships?  I will leave that for the reader to discover and enjoy without offering any of my own impressions.<br /><br />A fascinating premise and a deliciously-drawn scoundrel as the antagonist, this is a book that surprised me as it's not my usual genre and I found the story entertaining and mildly suspenseful as I wondered how in the world would she wrap this up. As it drew to its conclusion, the author had a little twist that I found to be clever. Unexpected.  I recommend this as a solid read.
