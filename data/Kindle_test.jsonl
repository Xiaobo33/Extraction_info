Enter: \u201cCrash Your Career.\u201d<br />In exceedingly crisp and easy-to-read style, Isaac Morehouse has penned the perfect pocket \"coach\" that celebrates an entrepreneurial attitude and lays out how to create your individual path in the marketplace to essentially \u201cbe your own credential.\u201d In short order, this book covers the \u201csignaling theory\u201d of education, the credential economy, showing versus telling, practical ways to build value and skills; and how to communicate both to a prospective employer or client or business partner, etc.<br />Although, the target audience seems to be young adults who are at the entry-level stage of the workforce, I found the advice equally helpful to me as a small business owner and freelance writer. Furthermore, homeschooling moms \u2013 (as I once was to my two daughters) \u2013 or dads can use this book to point their non-college-bound sons or daughters in a solid \u2013 albeit non-traditional \u2013 career direction.  In fact, with the right tools, Morehouse points out how much easier it is these days to do \u201ccontract work, project-based work, short-term gigs, freelance or start your own company.\u201d His practical advice \u2013 about focusing: \u201cearly and often on building the skills and mindsets that are applicable across the board. The things uniquely human, that aren\u2019t threatened by automation but enhanced by it. Creative problem solving, curiosity, adaptability, experimentation, persistence, communication, innovation, and unique intersections of both \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019 skills,\u201d \u2013 is definitely useful to all.<br />Last but not least, the appendix of this pocketbook features a gallery of real live \u201ccareer crashers.\u201d Some of their stories will, no doubt, inspire and encourage fresh ideas of how to break  out of the \u201cpack mentality\u201d in order to succeed.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Waking Up on the Other Side", "text": "Author Jordan Rivet has struck it out of the ballpark once more in Wake Me After the Apocalypse.<br /><br />As a comet named Brandon speeds toward Earth, the days until mankind\u2019s extinction are truly numbered. Even with eight months until impact there is little that humanity can do: avoidance of this tragedy is impossible. Although the field of cryosleep is relatively new, it may be the only chance man has of reclaiming the Earth and rebuilding. One thousand randomly selected individuals are selected to rebuild society after the impact. But with the devastation caused by a direct hit from the comet and the impact winter that will follow life will be wiped out for at least one hundred years. Taking a risk, the one thousand people who will repopulate the earth are given immersive training in survival; they are taught to follow the program set out before them; they are taught basic skills to rebuild our society; and above all they are programmed to not panic. All of this must be accomplished before they are placed into a deep cryosleep where they will remain for two hundred years \u2013 enough time for vegetation to begin anew and for the effects of impact winter to have subsided.<br /><br />One of the randomly selected participants in the program is eighteen-year-old Joanna Murphy. With trepidation at leaving her parents who she knows will surely die, Joanna joins the other members of her team \u2013 Blue Team Seven \u2013 and begins her training. The participants have been sequestered in a heavily guarded encampment away from towns and cities. They proceed with their learning and are left exhausted by the end of each day, too exhausted and too far removed from others to see how society is disintegrating as the time to comet impact draws closer.<br /><br />Fast forward two hundred years and the time has come for Joanna and the others to reawaken. As she slowly opens her eyes she is aware that there are red lights around her cryo-tube where there should be blue ones. Slowly she emerges from her tube to find that their underground cavern \u2013 home of one thousand cryotubes \u2013 has had a cave in. After getting accustomed to being awake and moving again, Joanna realizes that she is the only one alive. Lower numbered tubes are crushed and their occupants dead. Higher numbered tubes (she is number 188) are blocked by rubble from the cave in. She assumes that all others are dead. It is her sheer determination and programming along with her curiosity about what Earth now looks like that finally get her to the outside. Fifteen hundred feet below the earth\u2019s crust, Joanna must call on every bit of her courage, her training, her determination to get her through. And through it all she must remember, Don\u2019t Panic!<br /><br />Using Joanna and her cohorts as a cross-section of today\u2019s society, we are given a glimpse into the future. A future that may be bleak or a future that may be full of hope and promise. Or maybe a bit of both. The plot of the story is spellbinding, and I found myself staying up all night just to finish the book. Easy reading, characters to whom the reader is effortlessly drawn, a setting that is global yet condensed, all are earmarks of Ms. Rivet\u2019s captivating writing style. I\u2019ve read this author\u2019s SeaSwept Series (post-apocalyptic story set on a cruise ship) and immensely enjoyed all the books in that series.<br /><br />With Wake Me After the Apocalypse, I felt a kinship with the character of Joanna from the first page. Readers of post-apocalyptic stories will revel in this new offering from Jordan Rivet. This reader hopes that there will be a sequel to this book although it works perfectly as a stand-alone novel.<br /><br />If you like action, adventure, or thrillers, don\u2019t miss this one.<br /><br />Note:  I was provided with an ARC by the author.", "images": [], "asin": "B07G35YHLT", "parent_asin": "B07G35YHLT", "user_id": "AENBUXPSQTEVMHI7K4YJ3EYWNRPA", "timestamp": 1537458500522, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

(hint\u2026hint)<br /><br />Ben is undergoing a battle within himself over where he fits into this crazy world being gay male and a thinker most times serves Ben well, but his love for L.A is in jeopardy when he discovers the little town Mercury, North Carolina. Ben\u2019s past haunts him every day. Can Ben let go of his past before it is too late and the one thing he wants turns and walks right out of his life?<br />I will admit Ben shocked me a little he throws off some many vibes I was glad his character settled enough for me to enjoy him.<br /><br />Tripp\u2019s character is by far the sassy little jewel in Cherry Pop in my opinion. Between his antics; his undying loyalties and love makes him shine brightly. Tripp\u2019s story is not a true M/M relationship until he meets Ben before he has had experiences with women, but then that is where it ends. I enjoyed how Ms. Kane created Tripp\u2019s character, bringing everything Tripp was feeling to the forefront. Tripp discovering himself was a pleasure to see.<br /><br />Ms. Kane did a remarkable job with the lead up to Ben and Tripp. Ben and Tripp have to work through issues on their own and between them to see if they have a chance at anything long lasting. Their passion is there from straight on, but Ben fights it all the way. Can Tripp convince him that he is worth loving or will Tripp cut their ties?<br /><br />Supporting characters were a true delight. It was nice visiting with everyone from previous books in the Mercury Rising series. They helped Cherry Pop be a laugh out loud fun M/M romance. The plot was aligned with quirky characters who have a few serious moments along with some inner self-searching along the way . Samantha Kane gives us plenty of heart and intrigue that kept me coming back. It is quite evident they all love the town of Mercury, North Carolina and I totally agree.<br /><br />Rated 5 Stilettos and a Recommended Read by Deb !", "images": [], "asin": "B01E89DK2S", "parent_asin": "B01E89DK2S", "user_id": "AFOMUV5QSYQKNL5RBGCTD2EXHJNQ", "timestamp": 1463248042000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Daughters of the Mayflower, book 4", "text": "After my lukewarm response to the first book in the Daughters of the Mayflower multi-author series, The Mayflower Bride by Kimberley Woodhouse, I was contemplating skipping this, the fourth book in the series.  So, when Barbour sent me an email with a pre-approval link to NetGalley, inviting me to read The Patriot Bride, I decided I would risk having to write another \"constructive\" review and take the plunge.<br /><br />Happily, whether it is that the elements of the story are more suited to her writing or that her writing has progressed, The Patriot Bride left me comparatively little to dislike.  After a bit of a slow start with the prologue, though it very nicely set the stage, and if you disregard the slightly clunky incorporation of real historical figures and some of the word choices that may have gone farther than necessary to make the story more readable to a modern audience, this Revolutionary War spy tale was quite fun.  The dynamics between Faith and her two suitors, along with the ladies who attend her social gatherings are really where this story shines.  And whether or not the way the scripture memorization for code practice method used by Faith and those ladies is historically accurate, I adored it.<br /><br />Having enjoyed this story in spite of my misgivings, I am optimistic at the news that of the two novels now added to this series that moves through United States history as well as Faith Lytton's family tree, one will be written by Kimberley Woodhouse.<br /><br />Each of these novels can be read as a standalone, if there is a particular storyline or period of history that interests you as a reader.  I'm personally looking forward to specific time periods, but hope to continue reading them all in order.<br /><br />This review refers to a NetGalley e-galley read courtesy of the publisher.

The Gaslight Journal is an excellent foray in the Jane Austen and Charles Dickens' style of writing.<br /><br />It is the early 1880s, prime Victorian age in the United States and propriety and society is the end all be all of any young lady's existence. Miss Isabella Audley is a member of that same high society and while home from college for Christmas, she learns what it truly means to be shunned and to be loved by people she would have never expected to do one or the other.<br /><br />After a strange comment upon her arrival in town, Isabella begins to see that things aren't what she originally thought them to be. After she finds her father's journal, the ugly truth changes her life forever.<br /><br />Grammar/Spelling: I noticed some slight errors - very slight issues. For example (and this might be one of 3 errors that I noticed): \"She continued to struggle; he continued to stared.\"  Correct these small instances and The Gaslight Journal is perfect!<br /><br />Character Development: Ms. Rene's characters each fulfill their part in the grand scheme of the era: social climbers, snarky socialites and the occasional genuine good soul that manages to look past social status.<br /><br />Isabella is a smart, out-spoken and vivacious young woman and is hard-pressed to keep her thoughts to herself. As much as she bucks against the tradition of the Victorian Age of thinking, she enjoys her status as one of affluence. Though, somehow (through sheer talent by Ms. Rene, I'm sure!), she is still quite likeable even with her sometimes shallow outlook on the world around her.<br /><br />Izzy is quite easy to relate to because as a modern woman (read: I'd have been burned at the stake back then!), I too have a hard time keeping my thoughts to myself and refuse to let society dictate how I should interact with those around me.<br /><br />Writing Style: As I stated before, The Gaslight Journal could easily fit into a collection of stories written by Jane Austen or Jane Eyre (Must have been a very popular name for the era!). The only thing that it lacks is the considerable length that is normally associated with their great works.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "This book should be read in conjunction with Marylee MacDonald\u2019s Montpelier Tomorrow", "text": "A Million Ordinary Days by Judy Mollen Walters is a look at how a chronic illness can change not only one woman\u2019s life, but also those of her husband and children. Told in the points of view of each of the four members of Allison Wheeler\u2019s family, it chronicles the changes in each as Allison\u2019s disease progresses. Diagnosed shortly after her first child, Melanie, was born, Allison misses much of that daughter\u2019s childhood. Melanie is a difficult child, and with Alison\u2019s illness, her husband, Glenn, assumes all the responsibilities of caring for his wife and daughter and trying to pursue a IT career. Alison\u2019s medications are changed, and she finally sees some relief but stubbornly refuses to admit that her multiple sclerosis frequently handicaps her. When she can no longer perform her duties as a pediatric physical therapist, she returns to school to become a social worker. The disease and the schooling further isolate her from Melanie\u2014and her husband.<br />Once her medication regimen seems to be helping, Allison decides to have another child, Hailey, as angelic a child as the couple could hope for, and Allison is able to fully participate in the requirements of motherhood.<br />Each member of the Wheeler family is scarred in their own way by Allison\u2019s illness. It is fascinating to see how the family dynamic ebbs and flows based on the mother\u2019s illness. A Million Ordinary Days is also an insight into what happens to caregivers of those with long-term illnesses.<br />I read this book in one sitting and only occasionally was taken out of the story, usually by a point-of-view shift.<br />This book should be read in conjunction with Marylee MacDonald\u2019s Montpelier Tomorrow, which captures the heartache and the joys of being a caregiver in a long-term care situation. Published in 2014, MacDonald\u2019s is a subtle, carefully crafted novel that captures the struggles of a family disrupted by Lou Gehrig's disease. Colleen, the mother, attempts to &#34;save&#34; her daughter by becoming caregiver to the son-in-law, Tony, as his disease progresses. Colleen is an admirable character for such self-sacrifice, yet MacDonald captures her moments of being less than likable when Tony's self-centered behavior infuriates her, when her daughter, Sandy, is less than appreciative, and Colleen's loss of a potential love many years ago.<br />These two books capture the effects of illnesses on families, a problem shared by not only those who have family members with Lou Gehrig\u2019s or multiple sclerosis, but by those whose parents are touched by Alzheimer\u2019s or any other long-term disease.", "images": [], "asin": "B06WD1YLSX", "parent_asin": "B06WD1YLSX", "user_id": "AF6GCJWNAHZD343WBAFMMUJ3I24A", "timestamp": 1525932576802, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

At once quite poignant and personal yet exploring universal human conditions, the story of Annie and Adam will deeply touch the reader leaving them reflecting on the meaning of love, life, hardship and renewal. I was immediately caught up in the characters and the language of the story, and while absorbed in each new situation and wanting to continue forward with this quickly moving tale, I wanted to savor the beauty of the prose and the insights provided by the author. The story, while set in the early 1900\u2019s, remains timely and left me reflecting upon not only the characters, but on family struggles, reconciliation, and the importance of forgiveness in every aspect of our lives. A deeply moving and empowering read which I would highly recommend to all.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Story", "text": "When I started the book I had two thoughts pop in my head. One was the saying, \u201cYou can never go home again,\u201d and the other is \u201cThere is no place like home.\u201d I know once I left home, I never wanted to return. There was nothing for me and I wandered lost in the world for many years. Hannah has come home to help out and I could feel her stomach as it did somersaults walking into her parents home. She has been gone for a long time and not everyone will be happy to see her. Can she regain the trust of her dat? Will the community welcome her home, or shun her until she asks for forgiveness?<br /><br />It had to be a culture shock for her son Brandon. He must think he has traveled back in time, as he realizes there are no modern conveniences. His appearance will shock a few but he does have a stubbornness to him which I found to be endearing. Brandon has a lot to deal with and maybe by playing it cool he can hide in the background. The author knows how to write stories that tug on your heart and I wanted to hug Hannah and Brandon.<br /><br />Aaron is a hard working man who has been in love with Hannah for a long time. He sure was surprised to see Hannah come home. I could feel the tension between the two when they first see each other. How would you feel if you ran into someone from your past? Can Aaron forgive Hannah from leaving him so long ago? Things have really changed in Aaron\u2019s life and Hannah will have to make some hard decisions.<br /><br />I loved how the story was about second chances and forgiveness. Hannah has walked away from her faith and will have a hard time allowing herself to heal. I was in for a big shock in the story and never saw it coming. The author is a master storyteller with wonderful characters and a theme that whispers of grace and compassion. I am honored that I read a book that captured real problems with answers that came from prayer and family. Can you really go home again? Find out in this first in the series from an author that keeps me coming back for more books from her.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from the author.

I've told the author this when I've met her in Apollycon this year. She talked with such passion about this group. It was amazing to talk with her about this story. She told me what with this story she wanted to tell people that things will get better, you have to get through it and fight for it. Things can be very ugly for sure but things can also be very great! And well I totally agree with her!<br /><br />What is this book all about<br />This book is about Echo and Noah. Well stable loving homes and childhoods aren't something Echo and Noah are to familiar with. Echo was a populair girl until a horrible night changed everything. Echo is covered in scares and is very closed off after that. The one thing that makes is worse is that she doesn't remember what happend and that after that night she can't see her mother anymore. The only parent she felt truly loved her. Her father remarried her old babysitter, and has a baby on the way. He is very over protective and it annoyed the hell out of me. And the new wife comes across as overly bubbly and is trying a tad to much in my opinion.<br />After noah parents died in a fire he was moved from foster home to foster home. He is know as the stoner, bad guy because he punched one of his foster fathers in the face. No one knows that said father was abusing his own son and noah tried to help him. No one knows that noah wants nothing more than to get his two younger brothers back. Noah's brothers were also send to foster care and Noah can't believe that they have a good home. He is sure that it isn't what his seems.<br />After Noah and Echo get together for study sessions they grow closer to each other.<br />Can Noah and Echo overcome their own trauma's and trust and love each other. Will the truth about the night that changed everything for Echo be told and what other secrets are noah hiding? Is her right and is nothing as it seems or can somethings be just good?<br /><br />What did I like about this book<br />I just loved this story. I love seeing characters overcome their demons, slay them and thrive. I love seeing the development and depth in characters and really get to know them.<br />It's a very good story.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sweet and Sexy Second-Chance Romance - Felt So Real", "text": "Second chance romances one of my top five story-lines in contemporary romances, I was looking forward to seeing how Claire and Logan dealt with the issues that separated them previously. How they would be able to forge a future from the remains of their past.<br /><br />From their first meeting it's clear that the chemistry between the two of them is off the charts high. The sparks practically fly off of each other when Claire ends up at Logan's condo in the middle of a snowstorm that strands her in Chicago.<br /><br />I really easily identified with both Claire and Logan - their feelings as they navigated through the feelings they're still dealing with. It felt so incredibly real, so understandable. Claire, hurt and determined not to let herself fall into it again; Logan regretting the decisions he'd made, wishing he could take them back and not lose the best thing that had ever happened to him. And then there were the little things: Claire thinking how much she missed the simple touches, when Logan finally apologizes it touched my heart with how sincere it was - how utterly unstoppable. This was doubly impressive considering this was a novella of only about 70 pages.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the whole time they're falling in love, again, the issue that broke them up in the first place was never even a concern. The snowstorm discarded the possibility of it being a problem, and so they were stuck in a fairy-tale like situation where real life didn't intrude. Thus by the time they did have to deal with the reality of it, the only way to resolve it was through a grand gesture - which I'm just not a fan of. I'm never sure that the grand gesture translates into a life-long change, so I really, really appreciated the epilogue here. It cemented my surety in their happily-ever-after and simply made me happy for both Claire and Logan that they found a way to make it work - no matter how difficult it may have been.<br /><br />Season of Second Chances is an incredibly sweet, sexy, real romance that touched my heart and made me sigh with happiness. This is the first thing I've read by Brighton Walsh, but I've already added some of her other books to my wishlist.<br /><br />**I received this book for review from the publisher via NetGalley", "images": [], "asin": "B00F942W5I", "parent_asin": "B00F942W5I", "user_id": "AEE6WBFLQZNDLIPIKGJ6QTUXE6TA", "timestamp": 1389035668000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

That alone should convince you to get this book! It was freaking amazing. Like I went back and forth between loving this book and then being astounded that this is a debut novel. Seriously, how long has this author been denying the book world her genius?<br /><br />I have never read the MC books before. I have seen an episode or two of SOA, so that is about the extent of my experience/knowledge. I felt this author did such an amazing job letting me see the workings of the HOC's, without making me feel like it was wasting time going over the very basics. Furthermore, she did a great job making things seamless. There was never a point where I was confused on the characters, or the happenings. The author had really great timing, in terms of events, confrontations, introduction of new characters, etc.<br /><br />Ember is amazing. I loved everything about her, basically. One of my favorite aspects of Ember is that she truly sticks to her word. She is who she is. I really admired how once she and Mav are close (and I am talking intimately, and alone and personal), she does open up to him. The author didn't drag it out and make it be more than it needed to be. As someone who reads a lot, I REALLY appreciated that. I hate when characters have to &#34;argue&#34; information out of each other.<br /><br />Speaking of Mav, I thought the author did a great job having him be older than Ember, and I admired watching him grow, mature, and move on throughout the story. Again, I liked that when he was opening up to Ember, he went all in. There wasn't some partial reveal, and then more left to figure out. It was him opening up because he trusts Ember.<br /><br />One last thing...so coming to do this review, I realized the book is over 500 pages long. I am in shock. I purposely tried to take my time with this book. I normally read quickly and blaze through books fast and I decided to take my time. I never once felt like this story was too long, was dragging, etc. I am blown away how long this book actually is because it never once felt like it. This flowed so well, and everything seemed natural and realistic to me.<br /><br />Please...buy this book.

The manner in which her mind is poisoned by those rumors is insidious, the tale-bearers are so patronizingly well-intentioned.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde's characters are model socialites, some are chameleons, ever ready with the convenient lie.

Mr. Wilde masters the liquidity of planting a crisis amidst a silky smooth flowing plot.  The narrator all the while pretends to moralize like an insufferable snob, setting up the reader for that moment when he grabs the table cloth of Victorian mores, yanking it deftly away from the tragically flawed people in the story, leaving their tabled troubles and scheming, like undisturbed place settings and condiments at table, all present and brutally exposed.", "images": [], "asin": "B00D1CUDZQ", "parent_asin": "B00D1CUDZQ", "user_id": "AHJQUN4F7VWSFLEME2UVWWUVTLVA", "timestamp": 1374668004000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It takes an unflattering look at the Vatican, revealing the political infighting, entrenched bureaucracy, and nepotism that were hallmarks of the Curia Romana (the body that governs and administers the church).<br /><br />The author also goes into some detail about the church's inexplicable actions during World War II and the sex-abuse scandal, which are somewhat off topic. But then he ties it back into finances by suggesting that money played a role in the Vatican's decisions during those times.<br /><br />While a book on Vatican finances wouldn't seem to be all that interesting, God's Bankers is a fascinating read and covers much more than just finances.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Crime, Guilt and Identity", "text": "Leslie Budewitz, writing as Alicia Beckman, presents her second non-cozy novel, a gripping story whose characters struggle with moral and religious issues and the challenges of their personal histories.<br />  Lindsay Keller is a lawyer whose career as an assistant prosecutor was cut short by a courageous moral stand. She now practices real estate law in her hometown of Billings, Montana. One day in 2016 a wallet shows up on her desk\u2014the wallet of Father Mike Leary, who had been her high school religion teacher in 1981 and whose murder in 1995 had never been solved. In the wallet is a picture of a young girl whom Lindsay vaguely recognizes.<br />  Triggered by the photo, her memory flashes back to an experience 35 years earlier, at the beginning of her senior year in high school. She had made friends with Carrie, a new girl whose family had just moved to town. Lindsay walked with her to the rectory of St. Pat\u2019s, where Carrie\u2019s grandmother was housekeeper. Waiting for Carrie outside the rectory, Lindsay witnessed Carrie rush from the church pulling her little sister Ginger, the girl in the photo. Then Father Mike hurried after them, across the yard into the rectory. Lindsay never saw Carrie again because the family\u2014grandmother and the two girls\u2014left town precipitously.<br />  The novel has many short chapters that zig-zag through time, providing the reader with a patchwork history, much of which the main characters do not know. There\u2019s a murder back in 1972. There are the girls\u2019 interactions with Father Mike. There\u2019s the mysterious connection between Father Mike and Tony, the man convicted of the 1972 murder. There\u2019s Father Mike\u2019s murder in 1995. There\u2019s the tragic death of Lindsay\u2019s close friend Mary Ellen.<br />  Chapters also connect us with Carrie, now living in Portland, Oregon. Currently, in 2016, Carrie\u2019s grandson Asher suffers from the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. Carrie is desperate to learn about her ancestry so that Asher can get into a pilot research project.<br />  At the third-way point of the novel the reader knows pretty the whole story. What hasn\u2019t been related has been hinted at, although of course there are twists at the end. The bulk of the novel covers how Carrie and Lindsay pursue the threads of evil, guilt and love in the old story, first separately and then together. How do they discover the lies and buried secrets and how will they and Ginger react as their lives are redefined by the discoveries?<br />  Despite the chronological complexity of the novel, the characters and their quests pull the reader along. And Beckman presents a fine picture of her home town, Billings, Montana, incorporating with poetic license much of its history and character.", "images": [], "asin": "B09Q843NL8", "parent_asin": "B09Q843NL8", "user_id": "AHU3Q3ARJUGSVGNXBIMMSB345JDA", "timestamp": 1666451808730, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Part crime thriller, part mystery, and wholly full-on adventure", "text": "The Girl in Black Pajamas is part crime thriller, part mystery, and wholly full-on adventure. It is effectively comprised of two related stories that race along their meandering paths.<br /><br />The main character, holding the various strands of the story together, is Bogie, a hacker. He flies to his 'agency's' headquarters in Boston to help solve the mystery of why one of their employees was shot and his IT system breached. Joining forces with a convicted felon and his team, Bogie attempts to understand what his enemy has planned before he and his friends become the next targets. Throw in a missing laptop, some suspicious cops, a hacker nemesis and a number of back stories, and the action doesn't let up.<br /><br />Accompanying Bogie on his trip to Boston is his 4-year-old, genius daughter, Isabella. She aspires to learn the Five-Point-Palm-Exploding-Heart-Technique from Kill Bill 2, and keeps Bogie and his colleagues entertained with her witticisms and innocent view of the world. She inadvertently prevents the murder of her father on the flight, but will she be able to do it again?<br /><br />Holding the fort at home in Florida is Bogie's pregnant wife, Bailey, who is left to look after a troop of three: her and Bogie's baby son, Bogie's elder daughter, Amanda, and Bogie's granddaughter. This is made harder by the fact that Amanda's shopaholicism and inability to deal with her infant leads to her husband leaving her and her friends trying to entice her to make porn movies with them. But why is her husband being targeted by his ruthless police colleagues?<br /><br />Overall, the book's writing style took a while to get used to, with its frequent changes of point of view and quick jumps from one scene to the next. The action was constant and didn't let up, jumping from fights between families to car chases to murder attempts between Boston and Florida.<br /><br />I haven't read The Girl in White Pajamas, and this may have hampered my ability to warm to the large cast and their complex back stories. But the characters, besides being plentiful, were certainly colourful and the one thing that this book could not be accused of being is boring.<br /><br />*I received a free copy from the author in return for an honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "B00M9TZ4JW", "parent_asin": "B00M9TZ4JW", "user_id": "AEEBLE5G2DMYFHJBUOY4X4EWQL7A", "timestamp": 1432233142000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing characters with a deep connection", "text": "This was a very different book for me (subject matter and sexuality), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Manga/Japanese culture is definitely not my thing. But I really enjoy hockey romances and I\u2019ve never watched a hockey game. So...I don\u2019t need to know or love the underlying theme to get into the plot. I\u2019ll admit that I skimmed over some of the manga talk and Japanese god discussions. And the Japanese names and words got a bit confusing. I also think that a Japanese-based college with hidden altars on campus is a bit far-fetched. It\u2019s clear Cullinan is trying to incorporate her newfound love of manga/anime and Japanese culture into a college guy romance. I wasn\u2019t sure it would work. But it does. It really does.<br /><br />The character development in Antisocial is A+. Some of the best I\u2019ve ever read. The book is long, so that helps give the men time to grow (together and separately). But mostly, it\u2019s just really good writing and characterization. I liked how both men changed and how their development feels authentic and organic. I liked that toward the end, their roles are almost reversed. Both men had a lot of depth, but it takes some time to see it and for them to see it in each other. Cullinan has written a couple of very complex characters and makes us care about them. Xander and Skylar each have a big nature-prompted epiphany near the end which I felt I could relate to better if I read manga. The earthy insight is unusual for m/m romance books, so maybe it\u2019s more common in manga?? Or Japanese god lore?<br /><br />Another aspect that makes Antisocial different is Skylar\u2019s gray-sexuality. It\u2019s not often you read about an MC who just doesn\u2019t have the urge for sexual activity and who remains that way throughout the book. However, there is a wonderful slowwwwwwww burn between Xander and Skylar, and I never felt like anything was missing. The men are sensual with each other rather than overtly sexual, and there\u2019s a lot of communication between them to make sure both feel comfortable. They were yin/yang to each other (see what I did there?).  They really did need each other. Emotionally and spiritually (not in a religious sense) far more than sexually. There are a lot of romantic, warm, tender moments (they weren\u2019t hot for me, but might be to someone else). If you\u2019re looking for titillation, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find it here. But if you\u2019re curious about how two men can become close lovers without actually having sex, Xander and Skylar will show you.<br /><br />I wish we got to see Xander\u2019s mom stand up to his step dad (I hope that happened). I wish we got to see how Skylar\u2019s mom reacts to everything at the end. But, ultimately, this is Xander and Skylar\u2019s story and we do see their whole arc.<br /><br />Antisocial was really unique and challenging. It was outside my typical m/m reading box but I\u2019m glad I had faith in Cullinan\u2019s writing (I really like most of her books). I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d like an asexual MC, but Antisocial will be one of those books that I keep thinking about long after I\u2019ve finished it and far longer than most of the books I read.", "images": [], "asin": "B073W46BTP", "parent_asin": "B073W46BTP", "user_id": "AF7MR6QQUDHXECOY3FZFT3H5ROTA", "timestamp": 1502210331662, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

No, your female companion! No a highlander! Have them all and more in this romance :P<br />- Plenty of settings to choose from \u2013 London, gothic feeling country home, Egypt...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I really enjoyed this novel! Even though most of my ratings for character depth, sensuality in the intimate scenes, and sexual tension was lower...I didn\u2019t find those things to be as high since there were so many shorter plot lines it was harder to develop those aspects of it here.<br /><br />I didn\u2019t find that mattered to me here. This book fit something light and funny and exactly what I was in the mood for at the time. Yes, some of it was silly and even a bit absurd, but I ate it up.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sweet, Fun Science Fiction Romance", "text": "This is the 2nd book of a trilogy. I read the first book about a year ago and really enjoyed it. It tells the story of Marsha, a plain, orphaned teenager, living with an overly strict aunt, who discovers that she is really Emeleia, an exiled princess of an alien world. She's been hidden on earth so the evil dictator that overthrew the monarchy won't kill her. She falls in love with a handsome boy who is also an alien, and they have a special bond with each other. I know that might sound silly, but it's super fun and a great sweet teen romance. In book two that romance is strained as more aliens come to town to find her, and guess what? She's supposed to marry someone else, someone of royal blood. Also, she begins her training so that she can eventually go to her planet and rule. I love that there is a lot more about the aliens in book two, as I felt book one was 90% high school romance and only 10% sci-fi. The second book is much more even. It's a little long, though. I think it could have been cut down a bit, as there are a lot of similar scenes of Marsha and Rigel trying to sneak in conversations between classes at school because she's not allowed to see him any other time. You get to know her daily schedule really well. The real action gets going in the final 3rd of the book and definitely makes me eager to read the next book (where I'm hoping we'll finally get to see her planet.) I highly recommend this book to readers 11+.

Dark secrets and suddenly answered hopes. Aristocracy and working class. Unpunished crimes and long-overdue justice. All of it and more is found in \u201cUntitled: Crimes Against the Crown\u201d by Wendy Bayne, the first instalment of this exciting historical series.<br /><br />The beginning of the story lulls you into believing you are about to read one kind of book, something like \u201cJane Eyre\u201d or \u201cMansfield Park\u201d. You prepare yourself to read the story of a young girl\u2019s coming-of-age struggle in a somewhat familiar setting of a big, rich house with an uncaring and cruel father and them, in a matter of several pages, you simply get blown away by the story moving into the direction you could have never foreseen.<br /><br />The book is full of diverse characters; some of them are likeable, others \u2013 absolutely adorable, with quite a significant number of those who can fight for the number one villain status. I liked that there are also such characters who astonished me by showing their true faces. Another thing I liked about the book is that it offers some deeply satisfying turns in the characters\u2019 lives.<br /><br />Reading this book was like being transported back in time and transplanted into characters\u2019 reality. I woke up and went to bed with them, enjoyed tasty meals in the warm circle of friends and family, and felt my insides shiver with fright that we \u2013 pardon, they! \u2013 won\u2019t make it through yet another dangerous trouble.<br />In the most unique way, \u201cUntitled: Crimes Against the Crown\u201d combines a page-turner, which doesn\u2019t let you stop reading, with a rich narrative that draws detailed pictures of the events and also offers a deep understanding of the characters.<br /><br />\u201cUntitled: Crimes Against the Crown\u201d is a multi-dimensional book full of adventure, risky endeavours, heart-melting love stories, and high society intrigues.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Exciting urban fantasy!", "text": "The Summoning is an exciting urban fantasy that ticked lots of boxes for me including magic, LGBTQ rep, and romance.<br /><br />The book focuses on Isabelle and her journey to a special camp after she learns she has powers and she needs to balance herself if she wants to survive. Although she\u2019s excited to learn about this new side of her she\u2019s separated from her sister and her boyfriend and she doesn\u2019t know where they are. During this she is also struggling with her feelings for another student, Calix. He helps her train, but his mysterious attitude intrigues her a bit more than it should.<br /><br />I loved all of the characters, they were unique and easy to like (or not like in the case of some). The author also does an amazing job with description. I felt like I was in Isabelle\u2019s skin and I appreciated the gritty descriptions of sweat and the uncomfortable sensation of sand. Little things like that really drew me into the book. I also liked that Isabelle was a bit thicker of a person. Sometimes big thighs and boobs are looked down on and even though she wasn\u2019t always happy with her looks (who is?) it was refreshing to be able to relate to a main character\u2019s body size.<br /><br />I did have some small complaints with this story though. It had SO much potential but I feel like it wasn\u2019t fully realized. The pacing was so quick at times I had whiplash. I wanted more from the beginning. I wanted to fall in love with Brett and Jeremy before the separation, I wanted to know more about Isabelle\u2019s normal life, little things like that. Even Ash and Onyx left me wanting at times.

And you can only read the original so many times. Enter Sanditon.<br /><br />I read Sanditon, the original fragment, and a few days later read this book. I could NOT TELL where Jane Austen ended and Another Lady began. Her writing is sooooo meticulously like Jane Austen that I was seriously impressed. There might have been ONE split infinitive in the entire book, and there were no out-of-place, modern sentence constructions. For that Herculean feat alone, I gave it five stars.<br /><br />Now for the story itself.<br /><br />Jane Austen starts us out with a setting, a heroine, a menagerie of characters, a clue to who might be the hero, and the beginnings of some plot tension. This author kept it going in a highly believable, mostly natural way.  Since the hero is completely unknown, it's anyone's guess what he might have been like in Jane's mind.<br /><br />In the middle, I got annoyed at some of the characters and didn't find them very Jane Austenish, and thought the plot was a little too simple and yet labored. I might have expected a slightly lighter tone from Jane herself, and a few more twists and surprises before the end. The beginning setup hints at the possibility of a Sense & Sensibility or Northanger Abbey type ending. Our heroine seemed to develop in some ways counter to her earlier inclinations written by Jane. But getting Jane Austen right is surely easier said that done.<br /><br />But the ending is SOOOOO good, I could not deduct a star for the in-between parts. The ending is sweet, juicy, so very Jane Austen and so very endearing. I smiled, swooned and whooped at the end of the story.<br /><br />Bravo, Bravo Another Lady!

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "One of those masterpieces I did not get", "text": "What I would like to remember:<br />- The first chapter(s) of the book when two members of the literary class meet with Woland in the park got me really excited. I loved the way that he described the details of the place, the setting, the conversation. It was almost as if you could be there. This was very much a constant feeling throughout the book: his description of every situation and character were very detailed and felt real. This was something I liked for a while, but at other times it felt tiring since it was reading a lot to get really nowhere. Of course there is a lot of literary merit in doing it and I did enjoy it sometimes. But others it was just tiring.<br />- The introduction to the edition I read offers a HUGE and detailed amoThis is one of those books where I feel that not having the full context or more knowledge (or something else) may have impacted my level of enjoyment. The story was not particularly engaging, nor did I find much depth on the message; in fact I don\u2019t even think I was able to capture a message per se, and felt just like a long story. Having said this perhaps if I had known (or felt) more about the historical context of the Soviet Union at the time, may be I could have appreciated some deeper/hidden message(s) and/or some subtleties of the language.<br />- The book uses a lot of fancy language and extravagant words (at least for me). Since it was written in Russian, I also wonder if this is a product of the translation or if it\u2019s the same in English.<br />- I don\u2019t understand why he had 2 stories running (the one about Pontious Pilate and the one about Woland). What was the point? Again I am hoping there was something deeper that connects them. Otherwise it seems like just writing for the sake of it.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderfully entertaining! A real winner!", "text": "From the very first page, my attention was hooked! Seriously, when a book starts out with a preacher being kidnapped as a birthday present for a young lady, you just know there's lots of fun in store! :)<br /><br />I found the characters to be very likeable, so much so that I wish they could have another book. Crockett is quite charming and often seems close to the perfect man, yet his character also feels very \"real\" and human. He's probably my favorite portrayal of a preacher that I've come across. Joanna is also likeable, her strong faith is an inspiration and something we should all strive to match. I enjoyed watching her struggle to come to terms with her feelings for Crockett, especially considering that her father is dead set against preachers of any kind!<br /><br />Something I liked was the pacing of the relationship between Joanna and Crockett. It's slow and steady, but the story moves along in such a way that they admit to their feelings well before the last page. I love when an author breaks out of the common \"last page love confession\" mold and gives the reader a real look at the couple together, instead of leaving it up to the imagination.<br /><br />Though I didn't care for Holly, the young lady who tries to win Crockett's attention away from Joanna, I have to applaud how well she was written. Every time Holly came around and started up with her sly games and catty remarks, I just wanted to scream at her, but at the same time I also kept marveling at how expertly she was portrayed. So while I did dislike her, it was sort of a love-to-hate kind of thing....she was just so well written that she easily evoked real emotion from me as I sympathized with Joanna and Crockett for having to put up with her! :)<br /><br />Karen Witemeyer has a writing style that I just love... With plots that are completely original and slightly eccentric, her books are a breath of fresh air in the crowded historical genre. I've enjoyed all of her previous books, but I have to admit, I think Stealing the Preacher is my new favorite. If you're a fan of historical novels, this is one you simply can't miss!<br /><br />Thanks to the publisher for providing me with an e-arc for review.", "images": [], "asin": "B00B85M2PC", "parent_asin": "B00B85M2PC", "user_id": "AEPMOWRZQ3FJBS6VER5PY7XS6QXA", "timestamp": 1373867664000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I loved that she dealt everyone in there own unique way. I loved that Sam found love. What broke the camels back was this &#34;She hadn\u2019t been completely honest with him, really with anyone. She knew that once she and Ethan became close, she should have opened up to him, but she didn\u2019t know how to. What words could she say? She was kicking herself for letting things get as far as they had.&#34; I knew that with both of her parents dying of cancer something was wrong that just broke my heart being pregnant and battling something horrible.<br />Ethan's his brothers letter were amazing just reading them I felt his love and devotion to his brother and I knew what he did was right not letting Ethan see him waste away to Stupid Cancer.

What else can I say except I\u2019m totally in love with this author!<br /><br />Having read her books before and totally fallen for her characters, I knew this book would be no different. I\u2019ll be totally honest with you, I picked up this book and couldn\u2019t put it down. You know, one of those books you just never want to end.<br /><br />Emily Foster was on a flight to New York City and when you unexpectedly get bumped up to first-class you don\u2019t expect to be sitting next to the most handsome and irritating man you have ever met. Even I\u2019m never that lucky\u2026haha! This was going to be interesting ride.<br /><br />Jay, Jim Jameson Miles was the CEO of a billion-dollar media empire. He was handsome, charismatic and commanded attention wherever he went. Sitting next to a beautiful woman on the flight home was the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The conversation between them was light, flirty and humorous. Even I had to smile at the dialogue between these two characters. Due to extreme weather conditions, their plane was diverted to Boston where the flirty took on a whole new meaning. One night. It was supposed to be just one night of fun, lust and passion, and one night was all it was.<br /><br />Twelve months later and Emily has a new job\u2026 Guess where? And guess who is her new boss? Yup, you\u2019ve guessed right. It\u2019s Jameson Miles of Miles Media. I may have forgotten to mention that during the stopover they were only on a first-name basis.<br /><br />Twelve months had not extinguished the lust they felt as soon as they clapped eyes on each other again. You could feel the heat steaming straight off the pages. Only now it was going to get complicated, he was her boss. They both agreed to be casual FB and no it doesn\u2019t stand for Facebook!<br /><br />Would they be able to keep it simple? She\u2019s feisty and he\u2019s stubborn, and that makes for a volatile relationship. That\u2019s if you can call it a relationship. What was supposed to be casual was turning into so much more for both of them.<br /><br />A major catastrophe at work gave this book an interesting turn, a turn that even I wasn\u2019t expecting. There are misunderstandings, hurt feelings and plenty of tears. Will they be able to salvage what they have or will it be destroyed forever.<br /><br />Another handsome alpha male brought to you by T.L Swan. Yet again I fell in lust with Jay. I\u2019m going to call him Jay now because I feel like we\u2019re best friends.<br /><br />This book laid down the foundations for another great series and I for one, cannot wait to catch up with Jameson\u2019s brothers.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sweet and Refreshing", "text": "Bachelor Swap is the cutest, sweetest story I have read in a long time. It was light and refreshing and the perfect spring break read. It reminded me of a sweet, sappy Hallmark Christmas movie (minus the Christmas setting).<br /><br />I loved Mason immediately. He\u2019s a bit of an underdog compared to his twin brother. He is hard working, loves animals, and is very much an old fashioned country boy. He is exactly the kind of person I would like as a friend.<br /><br />Kyla is incredibly kind, compassionate, and generous. While her family comes from money, she clearly enjoys the simple pleasures in life such as helping others and walks at the zoo. She and Mason are a perfect match for sure.<br /><br />The plot was a slow burn with very little angst. I found it a little crazy that Kyla didn\u2019t ask more questions when her boyfriend went from an indifferent boardroom shark to a laid back cowboy who showered her with attention. At the very least, you\u2019d think finding out he has a twin would tip her off. That being said, I didn\u2019t find her blindspot to be a hindrance to my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />Bachelor Swap is a standalone set in Ruth Cardello\u2019s Bachelor Tower world. I have not read any of Cardello\u2019s books or others in the series; I did not feel I was missing anything by jumping straight into this book.

Buy me, read me, devour me...lol  So, when I was given the opportunity to read and review Perfect Sense for the upcoming blog tour and release of book 2 (Perfect Love), I jumped all over it.<br /><br />This is the first book that I have read by Amanda Cowen and I must say I was so glad that I had the next book in the series to start right after it. I d*mn near threw my kindle across the room. What an ending. I guess I should state that this book had me hooked from the first few chapters. Quinn Ashby has just graduated for Penn and is waiting to see if she has been accepted into Harvard to obtain her MBA, when she accepts a position with the Bexley Bruisers in the marketing and promotions department. Quinn has spent the past several years away from her father and younger sister. Now she has come home to hopefully pick up the pieces of her life and move forward. Well, that all seems to change when she meets one of the hottest stars in the league and Bruisers shortstopper, Cash Brookes.<br /><br />Cash knows he has life literally by the balls. He is an amazing hockey star and a dirty womanizer to boot. I have a thing for dirty talking hockey players and Cash delivers. His character is strong and determined to be the best that he can on the ice. When it comes to women he likes to play with the puck-bunnies, that is until he sees Quinn and his world is tilted off its axis.<br /><br />The chemistry between these two is crazy hot, there is plenty of laugh out loud moments and it is filled with a roller coaster ride of emotions. And the ending with have you going crazy like I said before I was so glad I had book 2 waiting for me to start, otherwise, I might have really thrown my kindle.

She meets Charles Grimsby upon moving in and is rather fascinated. Margaret has a number of challenges she\u2019s facing that jeopardize her safety, so she strikes a deal with Charles. He owns a brothel and needs condoms to protect his working girls and she decides she can make them.<br /><br />Give this book a try if you want<br />- Real, gut wrenching, disturbing historical accuracy. You get it ALL my dear readers. No more complaining no one mentioned the smells of filthy London. Where does all the poop go, exactly? Wonder no more! How bad was it actually to live in Southwark? You\u2019ll live every detail.<br />- Older main characters \u2013 I believe the heroine is 41 and the hero is 37.<br />- An experienced heroine \u2013 she\u2019s a widow and has 2 grown daughters<br />- Working woman \u2013 she\u2019s a condom maker! How unique is that??<br />- An antihero \u2013 he runs a brothel and lords over his area of Southwark<br /><br />Ok I wanted to read this book purely because I heard the heroine was a condom maker. I was so curious how that would be. I was not prepared for this book though. It was rather dark with all the descriptions of how horrible life was then. And I am fine with dark but I need some character connection for me to care about their struggles. And EVERYTHING was a struggle.<br /><br />I was pretty horrified by 20%, yet so morbidly curious I read the whole book in 1 night. Could it get worse? I had to know. And it did. Oh, it did. The detailed descriptions of every harsh detail of life. You keep thinking the heroine will catch a break. But she doesn\u2019t. I actually wondered if this could have a happy ending. It does. Technically it qualifies as romance. But really unlike anything I\u2019ve read before.<br /><br />I definitely wanted more from the hero. More time in his head, more understanding of his feelings. I wanted more of the couple, really. So much of this book is just...the heroine and her life. Her struggles. Her complete misery. How gross her life is. She is a strong character though. But I found I didn\u2019t really like either of them. Maybe there was so much focus on the descriptions of things instead of the feelings in their heads? I\u2019m not sure what prevented that character attachment for me.<br /><br />I thought they jumped into intimacy really fast. I didn\u2019t feel the tension much, except a glance or two in the beginning. And it lacked the feeling for me.<br /><br />The epilogue was so so strange. It was written like it was past tense and I felt like I was reading their obituary.<br />A different book for sure.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic", "text": "When Sunny runs away from home she has an accident and a kind stranger manages to save her. Several years later Sunny has made a good life for herself. She's a student and works at the university library to earn money to pay her bills. She's getting by, but can't afford the scratches on her car made by one of Max's groupies. Max is her neighbor. He is a talented quarterback and his career means everything to him. When he meets Sunny because of the damage to her car he has a suggestion for her. He will help her to pay her bills and in exchange she'll play his girlfriend, so he will be able to get some peace and focus on the football season. Max's sole goal is to excel on the field. There's no room for anything or anyone else in his life. Sunny never wants to date a jock again because of something that happened to her in the past. However, is their relationship really fake or can there be more?<br /><br />Fake Fianc\u00e9e is a romantic story about soul mates. I absolutely love to read books about this topic. It's the most special thing there is. I immediately loved Sunny. She's strong, determined and sweet. She knows what she wants and she takes good care of herself. I admired her dedication to her studies and her independence. She wants to make it on her own and I loved that about her. She doesn't let Max walk over her and she isn't one of his groupies. That makes her interesting for him and I loved the vibrant way Ilsa Madden-Mills describes their connection. Their situation is complicated and not everybody is happy that they're together. Sunny and Max both struggle with their feelings and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen to them.<br /><br />Max is driven and athletic. He's also an emotional person and when he loves somebody he feels deeply. I liked that about his character. He can stand up for himself and sometimes he's a bit of a hothead. I loved how protective he is of Sunny. He is a real gentleman and he treats her well. They have plenty of chemistry while they also become good friends. That was something I enjoyed a lot about Fake Fianc\u00e9e. Ilsa Madden-Mills explores all the layers of their relationship and she does that in a great profound way.<br /><br />Fake Fianc\u00e9e has a small mystery element next to its romantic nature. There's tension between some of the characters. I loved that every person in the story has distinctive personality traits and that they are all very well developed. Fake Fianc\u00e9e is a fantastic story with gorgeous and smart main characters. They have their flaws and don't run away from them. I loved the ending of the story, it's fitting and lovely. Ilsa Madden-Mills has written a heartwarming and wonderful story.", "images": [], "asin": "B01N192F1J", "parent_asin": "B01N192F1J", "user_id": "AEWOFGDZJMGNMC36BUAXVIQPDVRQ", "timestamp": 1487061121000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

If you love dark and twisted books, you need to read this! MInE is one heck of a messed up ride!<br /><br />Knock me down with a feather duster and tickle my tummy. This was as far from a light and fluffy romance as you can get, but it most certainly cleared a few cobwebs away from my mind and kept me on my toes. In fact, forget the feather duster, I need a mop and super glue to put my brain back in order after this, as I had thoughts firing off in all directions!<br /><br />MInE really is a hate story and is packed with secrets, lies, grief, anger, jealousy, manipulation and revenge. You know how they say revenge is sweet, well in this book it\u2019s not. It\u2019s an all-consuming messed up obsession that will have your head in a spin.<br /><br />I feel like I\u2019ve read about three books in one go. Not because of the length, there was just so much going on, shocks and surprises, and so many sides to the characters, I wasn\u2019t sure who to trust, who I liked, who I hated. I\u2019m sure there were far less characters in this book than my mind is currently telling me. This is the kind of book that has you wanting to read it again. To see if you missed something and whether there were clues earlier on in the story.<br /><br />It was like watching a car crash. You know you shouldn\u2019t look. You pray no one has been hurt. But the human curiosity within you is too strong to resist and you can\u2019t turn your eyes away no matter how hard you try. Next time I think my life is boring, I'm going to remind myself I'm lucky it isn't like the lives of the characters in this book.<br /><br />MInE has left me wondering how I could LOVE something that was filled with so much HATE. I think I still feel a little bit shell-shocked by the pace and intensity of this book!<br /><br />If you love dark romance thrillers that are fast paced, twisty, gasp-inducing and have you not knowing what you think of the characters, then I highly recommend you give this a go.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Glimpse into Haleigh's Life..", "text": "Where to start.. Where to start.. ;)<br /><br />I was contacted by the author to give my honest review so here I go...<br /><br />Haleigh is a young lady, a summer before her senior year in high school. Wanting to advance her education, Haleigh and her friend Karslynn decide to enroll in the local college for summer classes. I loved Haleigh's wit and devil may care attitude. She's quick, smart, and makes no bones about the fact that she has a way with words. Having lost her father a few years back she finds that her mother throws herself into her work which leaves Haleigh having to fend for herself.<br /><br />The \"love interest\", Mika, is an attractive exchange student from Belgium attending the summer college as well. He seemed to be sweet and considerate as well as a bit of a romantic. I wish I could give more insight to him but surprisingly he was quite absent from the main story.<br /><br />I dove into this book expecting some sweet love story. That's what the blurb was really focused on. I just didn't quite see it. I seen the attraction.. Kind of.. But because of the blurb and even the title of the book I spent all my time wondering where/when this \"love\" story was going to start. I first thought that it was going to be a slow build but it just wasn't there. And because I was preoccupied with trying to find this love story I just grew a bit frustrated..<br /><br />Ultimately, this book was about Haleigh and her friends. About meeting new people and building friendships. The daily goings on in summer/high school life. The banter between Haleigh and her friends were very funny. At times I was just cracking up. Truong and Karslynn were a riot (Truong especially). Although I was caught at times as whether this group was high school or junior high students. one moment the group seemed quite mature while other times quite immature. i just couldn't decide and it threw me off a bit. Aside from the fact that there wasn't a love story really to follow this was a very cute book. And toward the end you finally got a little taste of a potential love story. It felt rushed in the end. Going with the \"innocent\" flow of the book it really threw me for a loop the whole hotel scene.. Hmm.. Wasn't quite sure how to take that one. Where there seemed to be a slow build up of a relationship, I didn't see that kind of buildup. Lol This was such a cute story that if it wasn't for that part I would gladly let my teenage girls read the story. ;)<br /><br />It kept me reading and thought it was well written. Although at times I felt like there was a lot of geographical references and boy do I need to brush up. Lol  Pretty well edited and only a few spots where Truong was speaking to Haleigh but said Kars. There was also a missed opportunity to delve more into the mother/daughter relationship. I really think if the author change the title and blurb it would do a lot better. This story is more about the Life and Friendships of Haleigh than anything else. If I went into the book expecting that than I think this would of been 4-5 stars definitely.<br /><br />I think this author has a lot to offer and look forward to upcoming books from her.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Gripping suspense", "text": "The Little Girl in the Window by C. G. Twiles is another riveting novel of psychological suspense by this author, who can be counted on to provide strong story-telling with enough twists to satisfy the most discerning reader.<br /><br />The book is divided into two time periods\u201412 Years Ago, and Now. Romy, the female protagonist, is a shy 12 year old in Glass Town, a small community in upstate New York. She has a desperate crush on handsome 18 year old lifeguard Heath. When Romy pulls a terrible prank on Heath\u2019s girlfriend, Misty, the drama begins as Misty drowns. The guilt Romy feels persists and is referred to throughout the novel.<br /><br />In a smooth segue from teens to young adults, the Now is in the spring of 2020, and Romy is 26 years old, living in New York City, as the Covid-19 pandemic is in its early stages and not well understood. She is a successful cover designer and continues to follow the life of Heath, a writer of romance novels, also in New York City. They reconnect at a book signing event and decide to return together to Glass Town to avoid the virus now increasingly sickening their neighbors in NYC.<br /><br />Back in Glass Town, Romy lives in the house she inherited from her grandma. There she is visited by the mysterious little girl in the window, whose white hair and luminous blue eyes haunt her and increase Romy\u2019s long-held guilt over her role in Misty\u2019s death. The suspense ramps up, as Romy follows her instincts to unravel the mystery of that fateful night 12 years before. There are some unsavory characters and a number of great twists that kept me fully engaged in the arc of the story and the startling ending.<br /><br />C. G. Twiles writes a strong narrative with humanity in her characters and a twisty plot. I recommend this novel to readers who enjoy psychological thrillers set in the context of present-day events in the United States.<br /><br />I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.", "images": [], "asin": "B09BK6QS7Y", "parent_asin": "B09BK6QS7Y", "user_id": "AENVIIR33HXA7LSD64ANAJ4CP5EA", "timestamp": 1633391880155, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I even waited up until the wee hours of the morning so I could read at least a few chapters just after it was released! Fan? Yes, definitely. So you can imagine my extreme disappointment when the book was boring \u2014 hardly anything happens until the last few chapters. In fact, even those events can be summarized quickly and easily. So why was there a whole book developed to just moving the story along so microscopically? I sure hope it wasn\u2019t to get even more money out of readers, but sadly, that is the way it appears. This book, edited down to remove the fluff, should have been wrapped in with whatever happens in the fourth and final book; there was no need to publish this book.

He became involved with Jim Coburn leader of \"Coburn Gang\" whose gang is wanted for bank robberies. Riley was at the bar when all of a sudden Jim Coburn is up against two gunnies, after he accused them of cheating, so just imagine the scene folks and everyone in the saloon moving out of the way of flying lead. Coburn knows this could be the end for him, but he was taken at least one before the bullet finds him. Just at that moment Riley steps up along side of Coburn backing his play..Folks it's a normal situation in those times to settle any type of accounts with guns.what else is new..right?<br />This Coburn gang Gaylord ran with them, but he never killed anyone, just shot overheads to make them take cover. Coburn noticed this and decided The Kid needed to hear out disconnect from the gang, with the request, that h e but a ranch and if they ever wanted to leave the owlhoots \ud83d\udc63trail they would have a p!ace to go to. Riley agreed and told them where he would settle, they all knew the area, so that's how Gaylord Riley became a cattleman.<br />The town of Rimrock and the surrounding ranches/farms is bullied by Martin Hardcastle  who feels he can have any woman he wants,and the chosen woman should be grateful and  appreciative of his charm..What a bunch of malarkey, but that's how those men in the West acted.<br />Everyone please if you've never read Louis L'Amour, I suggest you hurry up and read his Westerns.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Surprisingly Enjoyable!!!", "text": "I was interested in reading a book by this author, so I grabbed the free book even though I've never really enjoyed m/m stories. That being said, I found I really enjoyed the budding romance in this story along with the hot sex. I definitely learned some new things. ;) But, the part I found I enjoyed the most was the main set of characters which happened to not be the two love birds.<br /><br />It was the group known as the Manhattanites that really drew me in. They were a diverse group of friends that ended up forming into their own kind of family. They each had complex issues along with the big issue of possibly having someone out to get them whether it be a real person or just Death itself. This 'family' drew me in with their craziness along with the love and loyalty they had for each other.<br /><br />I did find that I had a hard time following along with the story. Some of this was probably due to it being the 3rd book in a series. But, I also think some of it was due to this author's unique way of writing. It has a strange flow to it with lots of jumping around, but I do enjoy the craziness that this author creates.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and will read the other books by this author. I do recommend to anyone interested in reading these books to start with the first one. ;)", "images": [], "asin": "B00UKFWZXK", "parent_asin": "B00UKFWZXK", "user_id": "AFKH5S3CXEVOASF7ITVDNCD3FZVQ", "timestamp": 1440952346000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

I\u2019ve read so many of Melissa's books, and fallen in love with so many of the stories and characters, but Vi and Andre\u2026 this story is so deep and so complicated and so emotional it almost felt overwhelming.<br /><br />Vi has abandonment and trust issues as a result of her childhood, being taken away from her step father and half sister, by her mother at an early age. Her mother, being a free spirit, dragged her from place to place making it hard for her to make and keep even a single friend. She thought that her step father didn\u2019t want her. The little bit of time she got to spend with her sister kept them both from getting to really know each other and to bond. With all of the emotional baggage she has, it is no wonder that she actually abandoned the man she fell in love with, disappearing and leaving no trace.<br /><br />Andre is loving, smart, and caring. He is also very understanding. He loves Vi despite everything that has happened in their past. He had searched for her after she left, and never thought he\u2019d find her again.

As with all novella's I wish the stories were longer!! One of the interesting things about this book is how each story has characters who assume things about each other and the only thing to straighten it out is a face to face chat.<br /><br />The Mariposa is a hotel that sits on the beach which makes for some fun scenes.  It also has a magic wishing well that grants wishes immediately.<br /><br />In the first story Ghost of 913, one of the maids working at the Mariposa finds a room seeming to be occupied by a ghost.  I like how the two characters start to interact with each other without having even met.  I like how Mari is determined and has things she wants to do and is a strong girl who has seen some of life and has brought herself to a good place.<br /><br />The second story Butterfly Kisses Ridley is a Plastic Surgeon who has a  huge heart and works in Beverly Hills in order to do humanitarian aid in a 3rd world country.  She meets someone who on the surface isn't who he really is.  They work through some misconceptions and come to a friendly understanding.  Again the young woman is a strong person who is happy with who she is.<br /><br />The third story Dreams Come True deals with parental abuse and abandonment.  Reagan is the events coordinator at the Mariposa and also a strong character.  She meets a film producer who she assumes is a jerk but finds out how wrong she is.  The story touches on parental abuse and neglect.  But it is also sweet and fun.<br /><br />It was a fun quick clean read!!

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great addition to the genre", "text": "Milijun by Clayton Graham takes us on a journey into the spiritual and the supernatural as aliens invade Earth with a very different sort of plan in mind. On a far away moon, a miner happens across a cavern and discovers alien bodies preserved inside of rocks. As the miners take a closer look, the aliens begin to rise from the rock and leave the moon. One miner happens to discover that the aliens appear to be moving because of the light source the miners are wearing. With the aliens on the move, it becomes clear that their destination is Earth. Not long after, people in Australia witness the aliens coming to Earth in a mass invasion. Why have they come and what do they plan to do? It does not take long before humans and aliens begin to battle one another while others search for a peaceful way to coexist with one another. As the conflict rages on, humans turn against humans and aliens begin to do the unthinkable.<br />Milijun is a very interesting read in the sense that it does not follow the normal rules of the genre. The aliens do not come to Earth blasting ray guns and leveling cities, but rather have a superior way of existing which allows them to do things that humans could only dream of.

What if you don\u2019t want to be carefully managed?

They are lucky to have a dedicated and engaged priest, Father O'Malley, to shepherd them. Hard times bring out the best and worst in people of the town, and we see the trials of each family and their many sufferings, all rendered in clean fluid prose.  This writer is  skilled and effortlessly readable, but sometimes, for me, the story became almost unbearably dark, as the tearing apart of young lovers and the death of small children continued. Besides all the relentless humiliation and brutality aimed toward the Irish peasants by their British masters, beside the equally relentless portrait of starvation, and the desperate measures taken in hopes of saving themselves, I found my mind turning constantly to the refugee problems of today. Sadly, human behavior hasn't reformed much, because identical humiliations, cruelties, violence and deprivation are visited upon vulnerable people who are only seeking food or every-day safety as they flee our world's endless racial and religious wars.", "images": [], "asin": "B07B52K2TB", "parent_asin": "B07B52K2TB", "user_id": "AH5ZZPZZOOYJDLGY7XWCRRU7MZPA", "timestamp": 1575668741005, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

At first you may wonder what do all of these diverse people and situations have to do with each other, but as you read he brings all of them together and makes you realize that in real life how disparate people and events are tied together. So that a computer hacker can become the leader of new political movement. The reader will find that it is difficult to put the book down because of the interest in seeing how the various stories turns out and how the characters are changed by the common thread that runs through their lives.<br /><br />A very interesting and entertaining book that is more then just a political mystery.
