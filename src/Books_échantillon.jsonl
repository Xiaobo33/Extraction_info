{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Unique Psychological Thriller With a Few Twists (B+ Grade)", "text": "Thirty-two Annie O'Sullivan has a nice life. She has a golden retriever, Emma, a boyfriend who loves her, and a pretty okay job as a real-estate agent. Her mother may smother her with the questions and criticism as most loving mothers do when it comes to their daughter, but Annie treats her mother with kid gloves most of the time, just to get her off her back. One sunny Sunday afternoon, Annie is doing an open house. As she's packing up for the day, one final visitor comes to look at the house. What Annie doesn't know that this smiling, well put together man will drag her down to hell and make her second guess everything she knows about herself.<br /><br />Annie is forced at gunpoint into a van by this man she labels The Freak. He injects her with a drug that makes it easier for her to be transported deep into the woods and to a remote cabin. The Freak now owns Annie and forces her to live a new way of life on his terms. She must follow his rules, schedule and this means when she's allowed to bathe use the toilet, and bed time. Annie doesn't know why The Freak has chosen her, even though he has pictures of her from every angle of her life and tells her he's saving her from herself. He threatens those she loves if she doesn't behave. Annie has no choice but to survive, even if that means pretending to accept The Freak in ways that will destroy her very soul.<br /><br />As the months go by for Annie, she loses all hope. She's The Freak's victim, forced to do things with him that makes her slowly die inside. Annie has no choice but to accept her new life, until the day comes when she can escape this monster and go back to civilization, but as a shell of her former self.<br /><br />Still Missing is a powerfully written book from Annie's point of view in the present as she talks to her therapist, interwoven with her time with The Freak, a truly disturbed individual who abuses Annie in such a way that she would be better off dead than alive. Annie gives a very analytical approach to her situation and the after affects. You will ache alongside Annie as you read the abuse she is forced to endure by this mad man.<br /><br />What makes Still Missing a unique psychological thriller, is that there are a few twists, especially one major one that you won't see coming and may make you gasp in shock. At one point, I wanted to cry for Annie because she's given something so special that helps her live to see another day, but then it's taken away from her in such a manner that will make you grieve alongside her. As a reader, I was very emotionally involved and wanted to make The Freak suffer for what he has done to Annie.<br /><br />This debut by Chevy Stevens is a wonderful, intricately written book. Still Missing will hit you hard in the gut, and as you read the last page, your heart may become logged in your throat as Annie comes to terms with her anguish and despair in a truly brave and inspiring way.<br /><br />Katiebabs", "images": [], "asin": "0312595670", "parent_asin": "0312595670", "user_id": "AFPMVI6ZRR7KS7AWRIBCKILWDVIA", "timestamp": 1281286633000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A MUST READ!!!", "text": "My reading consists of music books.  I can't get enough of them.  Especially oral histories about the punk and new wave era.  I've read Punk Rock: an Oral History by John Robb about the start of the British Punk scene through Post Punk and Goth. I've read We've Got The Neutron Bomb about the LA Punk scene and also Please Kill Me about the start of the NY Punk Scene.  I love these books.  They are first hand accounts of scenes I loved even thought I was not a part of them.<br /><br />I was not a part of those scenes.<br /><br />That phrase is the key.  A scene that I was a part of was City Gardens.  City Gardens was the Mecca for misfit youths in the bad part of a bad city.  The club was the homing beacon for any punk, new wave, indie, ska, and numerous other genre's that played the underground circuit traveling between Philadelphia and New York.  It made Trenton a destination, regardless of how dangerous it was to travel there, because once you were inside its doors you were home.  Punker, Skinhead, Goth, New Waver, it did not matter.  You were accepted.<br /><br />The club, whose shows were booked by promoter Randy Now, created a scene in an area that had not existed.  In an era before smart phones and the internet you needed to have personal contact to make that musical discovery.  Sometimes you got to finally see a band you had only heard about her saw a band that you had never heard of.  In the meantime you make friends, became part of a brotherhood, or let it inspire you to create music yourself.  Patrons and Employees included Jon Stewart of The Daily Show, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, Mickey Ween of Ween, and Ben Kenney of The Roots and Incubus.<br /><br />The authors kept the DIY spirit alive by making this a book from successful Kickstarter campaign.  They do a fantastic job of taking us through the history of City Gardens.  The interviews are an amazing time capsule of musical knowledge.  It points out the struggles of the bands who traveled relentlessly.  There was no social media marketing.  It was word of mouth, trial and error, fans and fanzines.  They came to our house and they blew our minds. You can relive the the fights, the backstage shenanigans, the fires, the craziness, and most importantly, the shows themselves. Band like The Misfits, Green Day, Nirvana, Black Flag, The Ramones, R.E.M. The Replacements, and The Beastie Boys all graced the stage of this legendary venue.<br /><br />At the time we all knew we were part of something special.  This is a labor of love for Amy Yates Wuelfing & Steven DiLodovico who will financially probably never recoup the years of research and hard work that they put into the making of this chronicle.  You can't put a dollar amount on memories.  I don't think anyone that was a part of this scene had gotten into it for the money.  It was for the love of it.  And it shows in this book.  It details not only the great bands that played this venue, but the great people that attended and the great local scene and the people that helped create it.  The wonderful photography of Ken Salerno and the author's interviews help paint such an accurate picture of this era it's almost as if you are still there.<br /><br />I am proud to say that the words of my friends are in this book.  These were hard times.  I miss these times.  I miss City Gardens.  It was a part of my youth that I loved.  Fortunately, people like Randy Now still create a local buzz with stores like The Man Cave.  I have made new friends there who love the sames things.  We see shows together.  We interact.  We play songs for each other.  It is everything that made me fall in love with music in the first place.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "My Review of Edward Feser's work The Last Superstition", "text": "First, I would like to thank Dr. Feser for producing a philosophical work that effectively (for the most part) dismantles the fragile straw house of ideas that has been constructed by the so-called \"new atheists\" (Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, etc). Feser employs wit, mental acuity and reason to refute the atheistic claims made by Dawkins and company. I have enjoyed reading this work, although like any other book, it has its strengths and weaknesses. In reviewing this publication, I will point out what I perceive to be its strong and weak points.<br /><br />1. The discussion on nominalism versus realism (theory of universals) was one of this book's best features. While I do not agree with Feser's depiction of nominalism in toto, I believe that he has a knack for making philosophy relatively easy to comprehend. His illustration of realism using the example of a rubber ball was excellent. Since I teach undergraduates, I really appreciated the example and how it helps one to understand the Aristotelian or Platonic claims regarding universals. See pages 57-62 for Feser's treatment of hylomorphism along with a discussion of both moderate and extreme realism.<br /><br />2. Feser also critiques the Humean \"attack\" on causation/causality (pages 105-110). David Hume (1711-1776) argues that he is able to conceive a thing (a bowling ball, for example) coming into existence without a cause. However, Feser addresses this \"argument\" by noting that Hume is conflating or confusing the verb \"conceive\" with the verb \"imagine.\" But the two actions delineated by the respective verbs \"conceive\" and \"imagine\" clearly are not the same acts. As Feser aptly points out, it is possible to grasp the concept of a \"chiliagon\" (a thousand-sided figure) but that does not mean it is conceptually possible to form a distinct mental image of a chiliagon. Hume's argument suggests that he fails to understand this important distinction.<br /><br />3. Feser exploits the notion of Aristotelian final causality throughout his book. The final cause is the telos (i.e. end, result, goal, function, purpose) of a thing or event. One might say that an oak tree is the final cause of an acorn or that the final cause of a human embryo is a full grown adult. Aristotle believed that everything in our natural world has a final cause: trees, humans, animals, and artificial objects all have a final cause. Thomas Aquinas used Aristotle's thought on causes to build a case for the existence of God by the use of unaided natural reason. See pages 114-119 of Feser's work.<br /><br />4. Having mentioned some positive things about Feser's work, allow me to include some critical feedback in response to his work. Feser has a wry sense of humor: sometimes his jokes hit the mark and sometimes they do not. There are paragraphs in this book wherein the sarcasm and cockiness just drips abundantly like water. Some remarks are indeed amusing. Moreover, Dawkins and company probably deserve the sarcasm. Nevertheless, I would love to see less sarcasm, less of a smart-alecky tone and more seriousness pertaining to the task at hand.<br /><br />5. Feser might also have stayed on task a little more rather than being diverted by political issues or didactic moralizing about contemporary moral topics. The arguments that he makes, for example, against abortion do not contribute directly to his general thesis, although I agree with his take on abortion. I guess he is thereby making a critique of secularism or what has putatively happened to the world since the rejection of final causality. However, I am not sure that there is a directly proportional relationship between not accepting final causality and advocating the right of women to have abortions.<br /><br />6. Finally, Feser responds to the new atheists on the subject of mind. He contends that universals must exist and if they do in fact exist, then our thoughts about abstract objects like triangularity or squareness (two universals) must be immaterial. After making these observations, Feser maintains that neuroscientific findings cannot rightly be used to refute the Aristotelian-Thomist conception of universals since Aquinas is not doing science (understood in the modern sense of the word) but metaphysics when he insists that universals especially qua concepts and the mind cannot be material things. But I do not agree when Feser says that the findings of neuroscience which are largely materialistic should not count against Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysical demonstrations. Nor does it seem that one must per force construe mental concepts as immaterial, based on what neuroscience and reflections from modern philosophy of mind have yielded. Granted, the findings of neuroscience (like other forms of human knowledge) are admittedly provisional. But accounts regarding consciousness being a higher-level brain process have already been developed by some philosophers and neuroscientists.", "images": [], "asin": "1587314517", "parent_asin": "1587314517", "user_id": "AFUCGAQHBR4QZRYOUMYCVFKC4UDA", "timestamp": 1272759631000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

It seems that since it is so easy to publish things electronically, there is no longer any kind of filtering of what DESERVES to be a book!  *off soapbox*  That being said, THIS is an actual BOOK!<br /><br />I do have a few quibbles, but in debating whether it was enough to knock it down to four stars, I realized that that was a silly question.  The first thing I did when I finished the book was to click through to the website to find out if she'd written a sequel!  That means it's good, eh?  LOL!<br /><br />The characters were interesting, and well-developed, and I did quickly become invested in them.  I enjoyed the plot, and discovering the way all the interactions between the two worlds played out.<br /><br />My quibbles:<br />- Most of the book was written in a way that it was suitable for all audiences.  Then, out of nowhere, would be a gratuitous &#34;F-Bomb&#34;.  I personally don't enjoy that in a book, but it's especially jarring in a book that is not written in a harsh style where that might be &#34;normal&#34;.  It also means that I won't be passing the book on to the younger readers in my household, when it would otherwise be a book that they would very much enjoy.<br />- There were a couple of instances where the writing suddenly shifted from the typical past tense (&#34;Connor ran down the path&#34;) to a present tense (&#34;Connor falls into the well&#34;), for a certain passage, then shifts back.  I think it was intentional, and supposed to ... do ... something.  But I just found it confusing and distracting.<br />- It was a little slow in parts, but certainly not to the point where I was tempted to give up on it.<br />- The ending.  WHAT?!  Some things were said that seemed to be a character referring to something I should have figured out - but I didn't.  Or maybe it's just a clumsy hook for the sequel?  Anyhow, not good.  I don't read Stephen King because of HIS bad endings, so I hope Ms. Madden doesn't go down that path.<br /><br />I received this book free or at a discount in exchange for my agreement to provide an honest review.

Even though I found the story interesting, I can't recommend this audible to anyone who ever lived in the area.

Everything in South Arkansas was named by the indigenous people (mostly Ugahxpa), translated (roughly) by the Missouri French speakers, and later mangled (carelessly or maliciously!) by the \"English\" speakers. Few things are spelled the way they should be or pronounced the way they're spelled. But listening to that just made me gnash my teeth over and over again, which was a distraction from the story. The information about the law, the economic impacts of different events, and how those things intersect with the family relationships was interesting. Her few comments about the society and race relations of the times made me want to go read the previous book she refers to. The farming developments were interesting, and that part would be dry if not for the way she weaves it into the family narrative so well. It would be a much more compelling story to throw in more about the outlaws and ne'er-do-wells down the road, and what happened to them.

But this is also a book in which animal advocates finally get their day (as do those who, like me, are tired of watching the youth of America run roughshod over those around them).<br /><br />Red is the story of a man who watches as his best friend, a beautiful dog, is viciously murdered and sets out to get justice. It's as simple and, on some levels, as complex as that. To say more is to say too much.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the version of Red which I read (paperback) came with an additional novella titled The Passenger which introduces one of the most horrific characters I've ever enountered in fiction. What makes Marian Lane such a terrifying creation is that she is all too real. This is not an axe-wielding murderer or a won't-stay-dead-when-shot villainess, but rather the woman who might live down the block. That woman whom you've occasionally noticed has an odd twinkle in her eye and you can't quite explain why, but it scares the bejesus out of you.<br /><br />When Marion crosses paths with a former school chum, Janet, who is in need of a lift, The Passenger quickly turns into a suspenseful tale in which one woman's world is turned completely upside down as she fights for her survival against the kind of sociopaths we all spend our lives hoping never to meet.<br /><br />Two tales.

His father told him he would buy him a commission if he would marry the daughter of a friend, who was only 16 and still had her puppy fat, etc.  He was head over heels in love with a sophisticated beauty - who affianced herself to his brother right before the wedding.  He agreed to marry the young girl for the commission to join the army, but did not have the maturity to make the best of the situation (and the beauty he was in love with was piling on the agony for him).  He said some unforgivable things before he left, was disowned by his family, and essentially there were only a few letters (with more missed in between) between him and his wife and any other member of his family.<br /><br />He is injured, and writes to ask his wife to come and she refuses.  He finally makes it home after the war and finds himself not welcome at all.  He has matured, accepts his responsibility, wants a solid marriage and family.  He does not accept responsibility for the missed letters and I think he is right.  There were some things he just had no way of knowing, and having come through the war, this man knows what to take responsibility for and what is just chance.  My opinion is that he stepped up when he got home.  There were a bunch of bad reviews about this book, but I thought both characters were depicted realistically.  There was no insta-forgiveness.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I wasn't a mirror universe fan, but I am now.", "text": "In a word- wow.  Though I'm a huge Trek fan, I've never cared much for the Mirror Universe, seeing it largely as a means of seeing dark Trek antiheros.  \"Rise Like Lions\" completely changed my perception of what that universe represents and is capable of.  Here we see dark reflections who are dark by nurture rather than nature fighting, not because they are violent psychopaths, but because it is the world they must survive in. What is more, they are trying to change this world and themselves to reflect the ideals of the Trek philosophy that attracts its fans.<br /><br />Rise Like Lions is rich with cameos from the various series and books but doesn't become drivel fanboy literature that makes up for poor story with a plethora of familiar faces like books with lots of name dropping often do.  What is more, with these many characters the reader doesn't just see heroes and villains acting contrary to how he knows them but finds an inspirational tale with rich character development full, tyrants being overthrown, and individuals committing to paradigm shifts.<br /><br />Of course, being a David Mack novel, there is a lot of action.  The action scenes are fast paced, compelling, and are punctuated with nice twists which keep the pace of the book moving and make it difficult to put down.<br /><br />An interesting contrast can be seen between \"Rise Like Lions\" and \"Romulan War: To Brave the Storm.\"  Both are war stories with a lot of time to cover and filled with stories in need of wrap ups. Whereas Romulan War suffered do to this with missing action scenes and lost opportunities to provide meaningful character development, Rise Like Lions was satisfying, rich in story, and didn't leave me feeling like I missed out on any of the significant events in the time it covered. To that end, Rise like Lions has shown me how bad Romulan War was while my recent dissatisfaction with Romulan War caused me to be that much more satisfied with Rise Like Lions.<br /><br />I recommend this book to Trek fans without any reservations.  Even if you haven't kept up with Mirror universe books or DS9 episodes, you can jump in, quickly get up to speed, and enjoy the journey.", "images": [], "asin": "1451607199", "parent_asin": "1451607199", "user_id": "AH6PD3L53MHZHEXDS4LQCG32CLQQ", "timestamp": 1323297818000, "helpful_vote": 18, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely Gothic Suspense", "text": "Many thanks to Marion Sheperd, Troubador Publishing Limited and Net Galley for a chance to review this book.<br /><br />An orphan girl meets a very rich widower and goes to his family estate called Hearts-Hope and gets obsessed about the dead wife Natasha. Sounding familiar?? Well, the similarity ends there. The Ghosts of Hearts-Hope is an excellent Gothic suspense novel which feels familiar but is totally different.<br /><br />Anna Cooke  falls in love with Reece and moves to his family home called Hearts-Hope in the wilds of Cornwall by the sea. With her loving  and kind heart she sets about befriending her young step-daughter Ophelia. Reece's wife Natasha had been presumed drowned but her body have never been recovered. Anna has grown up having an intuition about things that would happen and soon begins to sense things in the mansion and starts having strange nightmares. There are rumors about Natasha's ghost haunting the castle and this adds woes to Anna's troubled mind.<br /><br />I could sense the plot line and the mystery behind it but the story is definitely engrossing. The love between Anna and Reece was brilliantly written and the growth of Anna from a young girl into a strong woman capable of being the mistress of Hearts-Hope is conveyed beautifully. Likewise, the efforts of getting a child to trust a step-parent has been written well and I can see that author has a way with using words that brings pictures into the minds of the reader.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing Boxset", "text": "Say I\u2019m the One<br />I swear Siobhan is the queen of angst and pulling every single emotion out of you. I always feel wrecked but there is always a reason for the rollercoaster ride we are on.<br /><br />When it comes to my review, it will seem \u201cweak\u201d but here is why. I want you to go into this book blind. You need to feel the emotions as they happen to fully appreciate all that happens. This is not an easy book, but it is so worth it. We are given an amazing group of characters that show us all their struggles. We witness two people that are best friends and after years with friendship love blooms. Then life happens and Vivien must move on. Ireland becomes the one place that she decides is where life will start over. It leads her to a fresh start but is it everything that she needs or truly wants?<br /><br />When the times comes Vivien needs to decide what is best for herself and her heart.<br /><br />Let Me Love You<br />I mean what isn\u2019t a duet with so many ups and downs you aren\u2019t sure which way is right?<br /><br />We pick up where we left off in Say I\u2019m the One. Life seems perfect for Vivien, but she is still missing a piece of herself. It was left in Ireland and when it presents itself again, what will she do? This book gives you all the emotions. You will feel, sad, angry, happiness and frustration, but in the end you will leave tears on the book. I hate not giving more, but I really don\u2019t want to spoil anything that was in the first book, though honestly if you haven\u2019t read that one you really shouldn\u2019t be reading this one since you need all of that book to have this one make sense. Will you struggle with pieces of this one? Maybe. There were a time or two I wanted to yell, but you need those emotions sometimes. They are raw and real and show that the book gives you everything you didn\u2019t realize you needed.<br /><br />Hold Me Close<br />I just love when we get these special novellas after the books have been released for a little while. It is like falling in love all over again.<br /><br />To keep this short and sweet, because if you haven\u2019t read the All of Me Duet, then this novella needs to wait until you do, we are taken years in the future and spend some time with Bodhi and Easton who are both in high school. Viv and Di might have tried hard to make life easier for the boys but as things start to come out the boys learn not only about sacrifice but also life is not always fair.", "images": [], "asin": "B0BW2SDDF4", "parent_asin": "B0BW2SDDF4", "user_id": "AH2VFDDJQKHST73WBWJXRHGS2SCA", "timestamp": 1677245302573, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointing Book...  However, these stories do need to be told", "text": "In \"Fagret: The Female Survivor: The survivor of Ona-Eritrea and her immigrant link in USA\" Haibu Hassebu tells the story of Fagret, a girl living in the Eritrean village of Ona.  When only a baby she survived the massacre of this village's inhabitants in which her mother, six older siblings, and more than 500 other civilians were indiscriminately killed by Ethiopian soldiers.  This book follows the life of Fagret following this massacre.  From her growing up in an orphanage in Hebo, to journeying with her father to Kasala in Sudan, to her immigration to the United States of America, to her visit back to Eritrea.  While Fagret's story is a work of fiction, it was inspired by actual events.<br /><br />A note of caution...  This book is high critical of Haile Selassie and Ethiopia; even though they are rarely mentioned by name.  Instead the author prefers to use phrases like \"Mr. Crown\", \"The little Jamaican god with his imported little dog\", \"The Enemy\", \"The Neighbors\", and \"Savage Soldiers\".  This book is written from the perspective of an Eritrean who detests the leadership of Ethiopia, its soldiers, and all of their actions.  I say this not to make you shy away from reading this work, but only that you approach it knowing what to expect and won't feel that the book is filled with too much hatred to read to the finish.  Otherwise you might not read past the first chapter.<br /><br />A negative mark for the book is that it is riddled with poor English and grammatical errors.  There are even entire passages that are repeated verbatim in one chapter.  To be fair, the author confesses to have originally written the text in Tigrina (wish I could put a squiggly line over the 'n') and afterwards decided to publish it in English.  A good editor would have been very beneficial to this book to catch these issues before publication.<br /><br />I gave the book a generous 2 stars.  If you take out all the author's political rants and excuse the bad grammar, you have a decent story which brings to light the horrible event that happened at Ona, describes the hardships of people living in those times, and tells the difficulties of being an immigrant.  While I can not recommend this work, I won't tell you not to read it either.  I do wholeheartedly hope that more people who lived during these turbulent times will share their experiences with the world.", "images": [], "asin": "1434313069", "parent_asin": "1434313069", "user_id": "AFO7FTSBPQ2TKEZ2HUXDJKZVAKKQ", "timestamp": 1198275596000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Part One of Two", "text": "I am a fan of most distant historical fiction, so it was with trepidation that I approached this more modern novel. If you saw the movie, \"The King's Speech,\" this is the story of how the older brother, Edward, abdicated the throne in favor of his younger brother, Bertie, the subject of that film.<br /><br />If you are reading this novel to discover how a king renounced his throne for love of a woman, then wait for Part Two. This novel ends where Wallis Simpson and Prince Edward meet and talk for the first time. End of story. I must confess that I was disappointed to read 400 pages of material, just to have to end where I was most interested in reading!<br /><br />The novel opens with the birth of Wallis, and covers her youth, debutante year, and two marriages. Unlike other women in her time period, divorce was not a social negative in Wallis' life. Instead, each of her marriages brought her higher in terms of social standing and in terms of wealth. Born to a flighty mother, her families on both sides had wealth and means. Her father's young death left his brother to care for her and her mother through her youth. Her Uncle Solomon paid her school fees, provided a modest allowance for housing for herself and her mother, and paid for her extensive wardrobe. Wallis marries in her teens, unhappily, and divorces quietly and cheaply. She later marries a man of some wealth, shortly after which she meets Prince Edward. Throughout her youth, she had kept pictures of the prince in her purse, and pinned up on her walls. She adored him from afar, and schemed to put herself in the right clothes at the right moment just to get him into her reach, even while married to other men. This is not exactly a story of faithfulness and morals.<br /><br />This novel does not include any pictures, even though it is based on historically known figures who were well-known and photographed. It would have been very helpful to see the characters, to see their handwriting in their letters to one another, and to put names to faces and families. Wallis, especially, needed the pictorial help. The character in this novel does not resemble the pictures you see on Wikipedia. You see nothing of her abutting jaw, masculine build, and large hands. Instead, all you see are the gowns, the fabrics, the make-up, the jewels, the flowers, the monocle, and the hair styles. You get no sense of her eyes, her posture, the timbre of her voice or the feel of her presence.<br /><br />The author does a tremendous job with the time period. Rebecca Dean carefully crafted this novel with the birth of flight in Pensacola, cocktails, \"dry\" states and brown paper wrapped bottles, fabrics, clothes, jewelry, gossipy letters, social cliques, and dinner parties. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenery of this novel.<br /><br />I'll just have to wait for Part Two to get the story I was after the first time around.", "images": [], "asin": "0767930576", "parent_asin": "0767930576", "user_id": "AFQ3W3L3DUL4LJZTJ7C6EBRAGLDQ", "timestamp": 1346694495000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "If there were an anti-Facebook, Olive's and her acquaintance's lives would be its perfect news feed", "text": "I hate Facebook, not only because people think it's the perfect place to argue with acquaintances and strangers about politics and political issues in the futile hope that they will change others' minds when, in fact, they simply piss people off but also for the fact that near-strangers/barely acquaintances think it's a great place to brag about the accomplishments of their spouses, children and themselves. It drives me completely crazy. And I've often wondered why we can't have an anti-Facebook where everyone shares the failures of their spouses, children and themselves and airs the dirty laundry that we all know is a part of each of these persons' lives but that we never get to learn because everyone is so busy trying to show the rest of the world how perfect they are. Enter Olive Kitteridge, a woman who is prickly, who doesn't give a damn about what people think, who makes mistakes left and right, and who, in spite of her flaws, readers (like me!) can't help feeling a certain affection for. Having read Olive Kitteridge years ago, then a second time (I do love short stories) and then keeping the book in my library after donating several hundred books during my post The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up phase, I was thrilled to have the chance to find out what's been going on in Olive's life and that of her acquaintances', relavites' and friends' lives. I plopped down and made it through about half of the stories in one evening, and the rest of them the following day, and as I prepared to read the book's last two pages, I felt emotional, knowing that whatever happened to Olive (from page 1 through 289), that I'd never get the chance to find out anything else about her ever again. Sadness. I loved every word of this book because of Elizabeth Strout's skillfulness at showing (not telling) readers every aspect about the human condition through the eyes of Olive and those who like, dislike, love and hate her. I think that Strout's character development is spot on and that she captures what it is liked to be a flawed human (and we are all flawed humans) in the world and still be able to get through life having made the world a better place, even if in only occasionally and in small ways.", "images": [], "asin": "0812996542", "parent_asin": "0812996542", "user_id": "AHIOJEXHJBLQERB7RW755WYQFZ7Q", "timestamp": 1562172895714, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}

Hardcastle deeply resents being assigned to a case like this and yet the more prolonged the search for this spoiled, rich girl becomes the more he learns about how morals are cutting all the bindings for the roaring twenties to come. Alongside this example of all Hardcastle dislikes about rich young women we have the plans being made for the wedding of the youngest Hardcastle daughter; a very different type of young woman.<br /><br />It took me a long time for this book to truly catch my full attention. I seemed to be constantly asking myself when something was actually going to happen. An awful lot of time was spent laying the groundwork for what eventually turned into a simple to solve crime. All of that to show the results of having served in the war. This is not one of my favorites in this series and I wondered quite a few times why Hardcastle and Marriott didn't have a good old fashioned fist fight to sort of clear the air. But then, Hardcastle is oblivious to how much he irritates people so I suppose Marriott will have to either transfer away from him or suck it up and seethe silently.", "images": [], "asin": "B06XWHPPV4", "parent_asin": "B06XWHPPV4", "user_id": "AFNQDYZOCYYTSOX4676XDCFIZY5Q", "timestamp": 1496325416000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful, Funny, Emotional Read -- fit for any reader", "text": "I loved this book from the very first page to the very last page - it was so good that i finished it in a day and a half. it is a charming, witty, and in some ways - a heartbreaking love story about two people (Emma and Dexter) who become attached to one another after meeting on one fateful day, July 15 1988. Time, distance, varied interests, and different career paths tear them apart. Unfortunately, they grow apart and although both become involved in a string of relationships with other partners over the years, they cannot stop thinking about one another. They never quite got over one another; in some ways, and are often left wondering if it was too late to pursue something with one another in the present day. Not to give the story away for any reader interested in this book - ultimately, \"One Day\" is a story reminding us about how the past affects the present; who we are back then and who we turn out to be today. What happens in the course of one's life shapes the person you become. Both emma and dexter realize they have made mistakes (romantically and personally) and realize that they have let many opportunities of a real relationship with one another slip away from them. Eventually, Dexter becomes a family man; Emma becomes an up and coming writer who has a television deal that is in production based on her book series. Rhere are several \"themes\" that Nicholls pursues in this book: the nature of life and fate, friendship, friendship withstanding the test of time, heartbreak, the journey of love-hate relationships leading one to discover that the person you love the most is not that hard to find. And once you do find that person, do not let an opportunity pass by you. It is such a bittersweet love story that touches the heart, and becomes an emotional read for anyone who has fallen out of love, fallen in love, or has never been in love. There is something for any person to take away from this story. I am amazed at how well Nicholls can take such a simple idea and transform it into such a magical, touching love story that flows effortlessly, leaving no stone unturned. He writes so masterfully that you become immersed in both these characters, including other non main characters. It was as if I knew Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew and felt like I lived in their apartment, their city, experienced their lives. His writing captures the heart with every sentimental emotion possible. Well done, Nicholls. A long novel, but is most definitely a worthwhile read even your most tired and busiest days.", "images": [], "asin": "0340896965", "parent_asin": "0340896965", "user_id": "AHNBAU445WWOEMBVRFGTJEIX6EYQ", "timestamp": 1308534230000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Looking for a new series to get stuck into ?", "text": "The book starts with the ending of sorts with Reed Kent knowing his life could be over in a flash, but all he cares about are his sons Sebastian and Milo. The book then jumps back and lawyer Lena Brooks is dead. Lena was one of the few friends that Gretchen had and she turned up to discover not only a dead body but also a cop she has a love/hate admiration for Detective Shaughnessy and his new partner Detective Marconi. Lena was representing Reed's daughter Viola on a murder charge. Viola has been convicted of stabbing her mother 13 times, the thing though is Gretchen knows she may be a psychopath and capable of murder, but she didn't kill her mother. Someone is setting her up to be the fall girl. The book then jumps back between the past/present and we learn that twenty years ago Tess Murphy vanished without a trace and her brother Declan thinks that Tess's boyfriend at the time - Reed Kent killed her. Of course, there isn't any evidence. This book follows several storylines including Tess's and Claire's. I have to admit at first I felt sorry for Claire but then after realizing what a beep she was, all cards were off the table. I am glad she died, I just feel a little sorry that Viola is taking the fall for the murder. During this book too, we read as Marconi starts to bond with Gretchen and I feel that this will be the start of a friendship between these two, and hope to see her in the later books of this series. We also catch a glimpse into a childhood incident of Gretchen's where she was a suspect in her Aunt Rowan's murder and I hope we get a book about this or more clues about where the \"killer\" whomever it may be is finally caught and convicted.  It could also be because of the name and also the relationship with the Detective but this book reminded me of the series Gretchen Lowell by Chelsea Cain except of course that Gretchen killed someone whereas this one is up in the air.

This book shows that some of his allegations were justified, though not his paranoia.<br /><br />The book makes the argument that US security was lax, allowing spies to penetrate all government agencies and even the Manhattan project. Indeed, US efforts to penetrate the Soviet atomic project came to nothing, and recent research shows that Stalin took much greater care to preserve his own secrets. But so what? The US was not a police society, and hopefully never will be; if Venona is a testament to the success of the NKVD in the US, then it is also a testament to the resilience of democracy. It is  a testament to the futility of secrecy and a powerful argument for greater governmental openness.<br /><br />Great reference book, it even has a list of all US agents deciphered by Venona. The authors also make a very good use of the Russian archives, especially those of the Comintern, though their research in this area is a little dated and will hopefully be improved by other enthusiasts.", "images": [], "asin": "0300084625", "parent_asin": "0300084625", "user_id": "AGKIBCHMUCBIBAKROUE7OOTKBU2A", "timestamp": 1177543880000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false}

It was hard for me to get attached to any of the characters because who knows when or if they will die, and because you're reading about so many people at the same time. Also, the writing is so dense it's like you're eating bread pudding; you can't take too much in at one time. It's hard to read these book for hours and hours without becoming weary. There's also  A LOT of describing food that could have been left out. I feel like I read about dinner in every other chapter.

My waiting was rewarded with this beautiful finale \u2764\ufe0f<br /><br />Just like the previous two books the words flow on the page and you are instantly swept away in the story (I really love how the author writes).<br />We begin with \u00c1ed being the king for over seven years now. He is more peaceful and Ronan has reached 15 years old. You can imagine how a kid this age behaves. And our helicopter parent is struggling to keep him safe \ud83d\ude01<br />It's nice to see them interact and watch them finally getting past the things that happened in The Hidden King. And hoping that there is a chance for \u00c1ed's heart to recover as well with a little help from \u00c9amon, the blonde aristocrat with periwinkle eyes \ud83d\ude0d<br /><br />But during the festivities when the veil to the other realm is open, a war between fae reached the human realm too, ending in lives lost and homes destroyed.<br />So, in order to solve his people's lives by reaching out to the fae courts, \u00c1ed, \u00c9amon and a fae girl named Erin go through the veil into the fae realm.<br />They will have a surprise though since a clandestine traveler had joined their party \ud83d\ude01<br /><br />From this moment on their journey will be full of adventures, they will learn a lot about fae and how they are organized, what drove them to war, they will meet new and interesting people, some meaning more to \u00c1ed than he ever expected.<br /><br />The action is fast paced and nicely done, with all the necessary ingredients to make good battle scenes.<br />We also have great world building with the different fae courts presented in a lot of detail.<br /><br />But there was something I would have wanted more of. I would have loved to have a little more romance and to have a sneak peak inside \u00c1ed's mind and heart.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Seven Nights To Forever", "text": "After her father's death, Rose Marlowe soon realizes he has gambled away most of the family's money leaving her and her brother deeply in debt.  In order to protect her younger brother who idolized their father and to save their family home, Rose seeks a protector.  Not wanting to be a mistress she leaves her first protector only to end up with another who becomes abusive.  Once Rose realizes she must find another way to support her brother and repay her fathers debts she makes a decision.  Once a month she works at a posh London brothel where gentlemen are willing to pay a very generous price to spend time with her.  She has became so sought after that she earns enough working as a prostitute one week a month to repay her debts, maintain her country home, as well support and send her brother to University.<br /><br />James Archer, a very wealthy merchant is miserable and lonely.  He is in a loveless marriage arranged by his father in an effort to gain standing in high society.  His wife is not happy at all about being married to James and makes no secret of it.  She takes many lovers and flaunts her infidelity in his face, however she will not allow James to take a mistress, threatening to withdraw her sponsorship of his younger sister if he does.  James loves his sister and wants to see her marry well so he tolerates his wife's emotional battery since his sister will hopefully marry soon.<br /><br />One night, feeling lonely and worn down by his wife's demeaning behavior toward him, James decides to visit a brothel in search of physical comfort.  He is introduced to Rose and is taken by her beauty, and lovely demeanor.  Although he has paid to spend time with Rose and basically have his way with her, James finds it such a relief to just spend time with a lovely woman who seems to welcome his company and he spends the evening talking and getting to know Rose.  Rose in turn finds James to be a charming gentleman but she is confused by James' lack of interest in having sex with her.<br /><br />James cannot get Rose out of his head and he returns the following night to see her.  In the course of the week, Rose and James develop a lovely friendship and they eventually become lovers.  Not wanting to let Rose go at the end of the week, James tries to come up with a way for them to be together.  James has much to lose if his relationship with Rose is discovered and Rose does not want to become his mistress.  She has many responsibilities and is determined to manage them herself.<br /><br />While Rose and James lead very different lives and it seems unlikely they would find any sort of commonality with each other, they come together out of loneliness.  As they begin to know each other  it is revealed that they are both selflessly making a huge personal sacrifices for the well being of a younger sibling.  James is not your typical romance hero.  Although he puts up with his wife's brow beating for the sake of his sister he never comes off as weak or wimpy.  Instead I always got the sense that he was simply willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of his sister's future.  He is a gentleman and gives the typical alpha hero new levels to aspire to.  Rose, is a strong heroine, determined to use her assets to keep what's left of her family afloat.  Not wanting her brother to face the shame of finding out their father squandered the family coffers, essentially leaving them in dire straits, she does whatever she has to do to see to it that her brother lives well and gets an education.  Both James and Rose are kind and generous to those they love and they are perfect for each other as well.<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about Rose and James is although they had misunderstandings, they were refreshingly honest with each other and avoided serious relationship issues with their openness.  Trust was built between them slowly and they both constantly surprised me with their gentleness and kindness.  They were strong characters yet very vulnerable and I found them both to be extremely likeable.<br /><br />Seven Nights To Forever is a lovely story about about two very endearing people who, against the odds, fall in love and find their way to happiness together.  Evangeline Collins delivers a wonderful historical romance novel that is well written, nicely paced and a pleasure to read.  I look forward to more from this author.", "images": [], "asin": "0425236838", "parent_asin": "0425236838", "user_id": "AE7HF3ICIT7GUWZZAELS3BWXFE4A", "timestamp": 1288704818000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

I was disappointed when Mr. Kooistra didn't write any more books, but such is the nature of the publishing industry or the author's whimsy.  Some of the critics difficulties stem from their not agreeing with the incredible mind powes of Dykstra.  The counter to their argument is that this is a novel and thereby normal rules of reality can be bent or ignored and super genisues may be created.  Another criticsm stems from the Christian element to the book.  Since most sci-fi tends to display Christians as people who are well intentioned morons or backwards yokels who need to be taught the basic rudiments of modern society like electric lighting, forks, and houses that aren't shacks, this book is sort of a counterbalance--and a welcome one at that.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Inspiring Story", "text": "&#34;He was singing to live,&#34; Met coach Ken Noda said about Ryan Speedo Green. There was much Green needed to learn--how to sing in foreign languages, how to place his voice, employing dynamics, reading music--but he had a personal energy and presence, a remarkable range, and an ability to &#34;stir a reaction.&#34;<br /><br />In 2011 Green won the Metropolitan Opera's voice competition, beating 1,200 other singers. Green's potential stood out. Yet, while the other opera hopefuls had studied at prestigious schools, Green had grown up in a shack and spent time in solitary confinement in juvenile detention, and had suffered physical abuse from his older brother and mother. Plus Green was African American, and few black men became opera stars.<br /><br />Sing For Your Life by Daniel Bergner is Ryan Speedo Green's inspiring story, how an angry youth ended up in 8th Grade chorus, discovered he had a voice, and after hitting rock bottom determined to change his life. It is also the story of being black in America where people of color must prove their humanity and equality, and talented black singers are steered toward musical theater and traditionally African American roles.<br /><br />Green was lucky to have found adults and teachers who helped him along the way. One teacher had students memorize Rev. Martin Luther King's statement about the &#34;content of their character&#34; which Green never forgot. Green turned away from the street life and befriended a boy whose close family offered him a sanctuary of acceptance and normalcy. Many coaches helped him learn to how to train his remarkable voice.<br /><br />Green's complicated family dynamics and history makes his endeavor to connect with them as an adult poignant. His revisiting the facility where he spent time, singing and trying to inspire the youth, shows his deep commitment to changing not only his own life but the life of others.<br /><br />Bergner does a wonderful job of explaining the intricacies of vocal performance. Following Green throughout his training could have become tedious to read, but his keeping Green's emotional journey forefront my interest did not flag.<br /><br />Green has established a very successful career, performing this year at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and in Vienna, Austria.<br /><br />I do love reading about how the arts changes lives!<br /><br />I received a free ebook from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.", "images": [], "asin": "B01A5VQTZI", "parent_asin": "B01A5VQTZI", "user_id": "AHQHNAXOEGSAZLAYOQRG3VR2DC6Q", "timestamp": 1475148759000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false}

Also, while there is an ongoing  banter between Luke and Poet, it is not the constant childish and annoying bickering that goes on in her other books. Although in general she has really good storylines the characters and dynamics in her other books have become a turn-off.  Unfortunately, just as in her other books she seems to be enamoured with the words cute and tool, and massages are her only reward or enticement. Would be nice not to see those in this series-edit them out already and find new descriptors.  In regards to this book,  Poet's fixation on not having particular photographs  shared, and running this theme throughout the book did not add any value or relevance to the story. She also seems somewhat hypocritical when she tells Luke it &quot;was not her secret to tell,&quot; but throughout the book not only pressures Max to reveals his, but also gives him a deadline to do so before she does.  I for one would be angrier if a secret was shared, and would be more likely to  trust someone who keeps the secret, not someone who goes around reveling what I shared with them.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Colleen Hoover Can Do No Wrong!", "text": "After months and months of saying I'll read this book but didn't I have finally finished reading Confess! I can say with 10000% honesty that I put off reading this book because I was afraid of the unstable feels I would experience from reading the latest novel by Queen Hoover. With good reason. This book wrecked me.<br /><br />Confess wasted no time throwing readers straight into the feels. If I wasn't so heartless, it takes a lot for me to bawl in a book, I would've been crying like so many people I have known to read this. But even though I didn't cry, I instantly knew this book would have a different tone then any previous book that Colleen has done. How dare you do that to us, Colleen!<br /><br />Owen quickly climbed to the top of my book boyfriend list. There's something irresistible about him. He's not cocky or alpha, he's an artist. A very sweet, hot, talented artist. An artist who paints pictures based off confessions that people leave him in a mail slot. These confessions that get turned into beautiful, breathtaking paintings. But, you guys, some of these confessions hurt my heart. They made me sad and made me want to hug whoever left them.<br /><br />Owen and Auburn both have secrets, secrets you don't share with someone you've known for 24 hours. There is a connection between them, but Auburn doesn't know how to go about it. She hasn't been close to a guy since her high school boyfriend, Adam. And she doesn't want to get too close to Owen, except sometimes fate has a way of getting what it wants even when you don't think it can actually be a possibility.<br /><br />The whole book was built on emotions and the more the book went on and the more readers get to know the characters, the more raw the emotions grow. Owen and Auburn share something special, that even when they're tried to be kept apart, they find a way to be together. The book was built on confessions and Owen and Auburn have discovered what could happen when they keep their secrets inside for so long without telling anyone. The couple learns to confess, and how telling someone else something you've kept buried can feel like a good cleanse.<br /><br />While Ugly Love still remains my favorite CoHo book, that one made me sob until my eyes hurt, Confess is tied with Maybe Someday. I loved Owen and Auburn, from their dynamics, to the spark they set off in each other. These two made the other come alive. Colleen Hoover continues to amaze me with the genius that is her writing. With each book she blows me away with her writing, her creativity, and the stories she comes up with. The women is on another world of writing and always has me waiting to see what she will do next.", "images": [], "asin": "1476791457", "parent_asin": "1476791457", "user_id": "AECJJDTDQZS4EQ4O7FZUW5J2Y4JQ", "timestamp": 1442444544000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Has God Spoken? by Hank Hanegraaff", "text": "I received this book as book review blogger for Book Sneeze.  As one who thoroughly enjoys the topic of inerrancy, this new, hot-off-the-press addition to the divine inspiration library more than peaked my interest.  With books like these, Hank Hanegraaff continues his reputation as the Bible Answer Man.  I must admit, the cover of this book is pleasing and professional to look at, much better than some of the older, albeit well-written, works of the same category that were subject to the more disagreeable cover designs of the '80s and '90s.<br /><br />As for the subject matter itself, this is an oft written subject.  As it should be.  What one believes to be true about the Bible in relation to God and in relation to its reliability in the truth it claims is foundational to salvation and to one's approach to the Christian life.<br /><br />Moving on to the table of contents one can already perceive our apologist's approach - mnemonics.  This can be expected for a book written by one who frequently answers basic questions about Christianity and wants to compile a book that is easy to remember and easy to recall information for apologetic use.  This means several things.  One, this book will give great, concise proofs for Biblical inspiration through topical acronyms.  They won't be complex or hard to understand.  They will be recognizable and real. Two, it is a survey book.  The self-same benefit is also a limiting factor. It won't have extensive/comprehensive information for each of the proofs given for the Bible's inspiration.  They will be short and sweet, will provide some hard-hitting facts and examples, but there wont be much space dedicated to follow up.  Further study will require other specialty books.<br /><br />Now, for the meat and potatoes!<br /><br />There are four main topics, each with their corresponding acronym: Manuscript (C.O.P.I.E.S.), Archaeology(S.P.A.D.E.), Prophecy (S.T.A.R.S.), and Scripture (L.I.G.H.T.S.).<br /><br />Part One: Manuscript COPIES<br />Copyist Practices, Oral Culture, Papyrus and Parchment, Internal Evidence, External Evidence, Science of Textual Criticism.<br /><br />Part Two: Archaeologist's SPADE<br />Steles and Stones, Pools and Fools, Assyrian Archaeology, Dead Sea Scrolls, Epic of Gilgamesh.<br /><br />Part Three: Prophetic STARS<br />Succession of Nations, Typological Prophesy, Abomination of Desolation, Resurrection Prophesies, Superstar ABC's.<br /><br />Part Four: Scriptural LIGHTS<br />Literal Principle, Illumination Principle, Grammatical Principle, Historical Principle, Typology Principle, Synergy Principle.<br /><br />If there was one easy way how to describe the so-called 'errors' in the Bible, explaining them through a succession of principles was the best form I can think of.  Though 'easy' is a misnomer because there is no simple and easy way to academically provide the evidence for the reliability of a historical document.  There is no way to give 100% proof to describe away what was actually said or written on our manuscripts.  That is because language cannot be nailed to a wall so objectively, not now, not two-thousand years ago.  The way people think, talk, and write are governed by the copious principles by which they perceive the world, and such a thing is dramatically different today than it was back in Bible times.  But those are the exact factors which we need to examine more closely in order to understand where our perceived 'discrepancies' are actually nothing more than preconceived biases.  And the four parts of Hanegraaff's book do well to cover a majority of the salient evidences available.  This is the stuff students could spend an entire graduate degree studying, so this summary is valuable to the lay Christian desiring to have a backdrop.<br /><br />There have been many negative reviews about this book. Some say he bashed other religions and authors too much.  That is probably true.  It isn't the place for a survey book to attempt to make any hard-hitting claims about the opposition.  It is better to leave that to the academics writing academic books where more detailed and documented evidences can be cited and extracted. As I read through chapter to chapter I found myself feeling a sense of deja-vu because he quotes and re-quotes the opposition ad nauseam.  Again, I understand that Hanegraaff decided to take a more apologetic approach to this subject matter, however, the portions where he describes the opposition and makes to refute them were more distracting than helpful in this case, and I think I would have enjoyed the book more had he stuck to the facts and simply integrated dissenting views with brief transitional rebuttals where they fit naturally in the text.<br /><br />Other reviews complain about the nature of the book, that it is a basic survey book. That is unwarrented.  The book had a specific audience and purpose, and it was written to that end.  There is no need to criticize that.<br /><br />As a survey book, this is a wonderful introduction into the Bible's divine inspiration.  Granted, it will require other resources for further research and study.  I would recommend the following if you want to dig even deeper after reading Hanegraaff's book:<br /><br />1.)

It\u2019s an amazing document that will open your eyes to unsuspected truths.<br /><br />Our Common Ground is more than a compilation of those essays. It is a piercing revelation of the minds and voices of America, direct and in their own words. And it\u2019s crammed full of insights that you won\u2019t see anywhere else in our polarized media world.<br /><br />What Diane has done is to reveal how voters speak in their own words. If you are a Democrat, there is no better way to not just understand, but empathize with the perspective of the Trump voter than to listen to what they say. Their attitudes on everything from abortion to foreign policy reveal careful thought and calculated analysis. Everyone quoted in this book is impassioned, but mostly in ways that you can relate to. The same is true if you are a Republican \u2014 you will learn about a common set of Democratic perspectives from common people that are far different from what you hear on Fox News.<br /><br />The result of reading all this is that you can actually gain an understanding of how voters with a different perspective from your own think, what it would take to connect with them, and how we can move forward together as a nation.<br /><br />Each of us has been programmed to see the voters on the other side as misguided and stupid, since the media, especially television, tends to find the most misguided and stupid people, put them on display, and then invite us to ridicule them. From that starting point, it\u2019s easy to demonize the large chunk of the electorate with which you disagree. But these people are talking sense \u2014 or at least, not talking nonsense. I\u2019d like to hear more from them. I\u2019d like to understand them.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A must read for youth soccer coaches", "text": "This book is the official coaching manual of the Dutch FA.  The Dutch are well-known for their youth development programs, tactics, and excellent teams, including the dynamic teams of the early 1970's, total soccer, Ajax, etc.  They have refined the identification and development of soccer talent into an art form, and in this book, you can get some nice pointers about how to do that.<br /><br />This book will not give you exercises to improve dribbling, shooting, or controlling the ball, nor does it describe specific techniques.  Rather, the Dutch method is to create game-like situations, centered on a limited number of basic games, particularly 4 v. 4 games.  Indeed, the book repeatedly cautions coaches to use other drills sparingly.<br /><br />Most interestingly, within the games presented in the book, there is a detailed description of various problems a coach may observe (\"what a coach sees\"), coupled with solutions (\"what the coach does/says).  By paging through the games presented and the problems identified by the coach, the manual provides a roadmap to developing training sessions.<br /><br />This book is hands-down one of my favorite coaching books, along with Horst Wein's [[ASIN:0736069488 Developing Youth Football Players]].  I suspect it would be most useful for a coach to have had a decent amount of experience playing soccer, since the methods described in it focus largely upon a coach making observations and then implementing a plan to address those observations.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "I am breathless!", "text": "This is a rich, well-structured, detailed, and yet extremely exciting book that I could not put down for all of its 500-plus pages. Some reviewers have compared it to the DaVinci Code, but I think the writing is MUCH better than that, and the characters are better-drawn and more realistic. If I can compare Kostova's writing to anyone else's, it would be to Arturo Perez-Reverte, who writes equally intelligent mysteries that grip the reader by the throat (pun intended here) and don't let go until the last page.<br /><br />There is almost nothing in this book that requires the reader to suspend disbelief -- and, in a book about vampires, that's pretty amazing. I found myself feeling that all of the characters in this book could have existed, and could exist now, in any city in the world.<br /><br />There was only one small detail that bothered me, and maybe this shows how much of a nit-picker I can be when I read a book. Late in the novel, one character who has been known as \"Rossi\" throughout the book (Bartolomeo Rossi, the graduate advisor and historian) is suddenly referred to by another main character, his student, as \"Ross.\" This happens in a critical part of the story, and at first I thought it was a typo, but then I saw it at least two more times, and it took me out of the story completely.

However, on the afternoon that she should be saying &#34;yes&#34; to the guy, she instead has a revelation after she sees a couple in public in a very compromising exhibition.  She realizes &#34;the guy&#34; really isn't perfect after all.  She realizes that she hasn't experienced everything she feels like she should have before she ties the knot.  This leads Brie to coming up with a list of sorts to engage in before she finds the perfect guy that she doesn't have to fix to make perfect.<br /><br />Conquest is hilarious.  It is also a modern take on women going after what they want without feeling shamed by being female.  Brie's new list makes her let go of the pressure of finding the &#34;right&#34; person and it was refreshing.  This book pushes gender roles and what one is &#34;expected&#34; to be like.

The book does not have that much romance in it. But, I was pulling for the partners to get together. I am still hoping that Cross and Phillips will get together. But, I do like the tension between the two knowing they both have feelings for each other but neither wanting to admit that they do.<br /><br />I don't feel that the story line was one that could not happen in real life one day. I know that Mediums help now a days with crimes. It would be nice to see if they could help out more. I know that is a touchy subject but it could help more if they were recognized more.<br /><br />I am excited to see more from this series. I just can't wait until the next book comes out.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing, timely read", "text": "Wow, this one was tough. Lucy seems like a normal sixteen-year old girl to those who know her, but, like many kids, she has something to hide at home. Her mom is a hoarder, and they live in massive piles of filth that Lucy has to hide from the world, including her new best friend and a new crush. Just as things start to look up for Lucy, her mom is accidentally killed (that's not a spoiler- that's the whole premise of the book), and Lucy struggles with whether or not to immediately contact 911 or attempt to do something about the mess in order to keep the family secret safe and maintain some type of normal life.<br /><br />The book takes place within about a 20-hour span with flashbacks so we see just what Lucy's life with her mother has been like. The flashbacks help us understand what seems like Lucy's apathy at her mother's death. Some reviewers are shocked at Lucy's feelings and actions, but I think Omololu is spot-on with the character development here in explaining why Lucy would feel the way she does. The scene where her mother's hand accidentally brushes her leg is heart-breaking and shows Lucy's true feelings.<br /><br />I felt like I saw the ending coming early on, but that didn't bother me so much.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "All About Sunday... not much about monday", "text": "Have you ever heard someone say something like, \" Church must be relevant to the lost people who need Christ?\"<br />It's something I hear all the time.<br /><br />And it's something I agree with...<br /><br />However when you start talking to them you find they have a completely different idea of what a \"relevant\" church looks like...<br />In most cases in my life this confusion stems from different uses of the word \"Church.\"<br /><br />For many people \"Church\" refers to the structures, services, and programs offered by an organization... and often time is simply shorthand for talking about Sunday morning services.<br />My understanding of \"Church\" is the community of believers baptized into christ. You might see how this can get confusing.<br /><br />I just finished a book by Pastor Brad Powell called \"Change Your Church for Good.\" All and all it wasn't a bad book but I think the name \"change your Sunday for good\" might have been more appropriate.<br /><br />Let me tell you why...<br /><br />For all my years in ministry I have heard about Pastor Brad Powell. Brad is the pastor of North Ridge church in Plymouth, Michigan, the largest church near my home town of Ann Arbor. I remember touring their expansive youth area, going to concerts in their stadium style sanctuary, and talking to countless people in the area about their experiences attending or visiting this church, but somehow I never actually attended a service there. The life of their church has been something that has always remained somewhat enigmatic to me.<br /><br />Because of this I was really interested in reading \"Change Your Church for Good,\" Powells new book, and was blessed to receive a complementary copy of the book from Thomas Nelson.<br /><br />The book is in many ways a history of Northridge and the changes Pastor Powell believes resulted in their great growth. For him the core of what made the church grow seems to be linked with a concern for the well being of outsiders rather then insiders a.k.a. Making \"church\" more relevant.<br /><br />Powells process  of making church more relevant for the lost seems to be centered around the Sunday service. This is intended to give the attendees a experience that is easy to follow with an aesthetic that is easy to swallow.<br /><br />This is accomplished by using language that is easy to understand, a message that can be picked up by anyone and applied to their lives, music that mimics popular formulas, and an environment devoid of any of the potentially confusing vestments, art and architecture of the historical church.<br /><br />Within this candy coating Powell argues that there should be a strong foundation on Biblical truth that does not suffer from cultural erosion. Powell likens historical church structures to a hand pump that delivers living water in a way that has become irrelevant in the age of the mega church faucet. Traditional church structures \"put people to sleep,\" according to Powell, but new one wake them up.<br /><br />What is waking them up? Is it the videos and music or is it the conviction and life of the Holy Spirit?<br />I have gone to just about every kind of church service there is, and every single one I have gone to has a predictable formula and order. If you are simply trying to surprise people with a service it will get very old very fast.<br /><br />Wouldn't the world be much more shocked by lives that consistently demonstrate love then with a service that consistently mimics their surroundings.<br /><br />On the surface \"Change Your Church for Good\" seems to be a book that teaches pastors how to make a service that make it easy for people to fit God into their lives. With a message of \"make attenders of all nations\" rather then make disciples...<br /><br />This is too harsh though...<br /><br />It's clear that Powell has a passion for reaching the lost, and hurt people with the message of Jesus. I am actually very glad for the work he is doing in my hometown. The book offers valuable insight to the the difficulties of leading a church organization. Powell discusses how to build up leaders, make gradual changes, and steer clear on some very real dangers that any pastor or church leader may face.<br /><br />I would like to hear more about how Powell works to make disciples once he had attenders.<br /><br />Sunday is the beginning the first day of creation and the day where a group of confused women first discovered that Jesus was risen two thousand years ago. This surprising discovery is often the experience of people who come to Northridge.<br /><br />So thank you Brad! Keep up the good work.<br /><br />However in my own spiritual life I have found that the means though which God has formed me have been through many of the same religious rituals and traditions that Powell rejects as the irrelevant \"hand-pump.\"<br /><br />Doesn't water taste so much sweeter when you have to work for it?<br /><br />Sunday is ALSO the end... the Eighth Day, the eschaton, where we celebrate in the liturgy with the angels and saints in praise of God and commune with Christ himself. This is something I get a taste of in the traditional liturgies of the church.<br /><br />We are all believes between Sundays... living as part of the Church.", "images": [], "asin": "1418543667", "parent_asin": "1418543667", "user_id": "AEW7IVGZTE7VTYIFTNX7DPBNEHPQ", "timestamp": 1278796786000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hesitant at first, but heart warming by the end", "text": "The Wild Court is a book I had been looking forward to for a while. It was one of the first advanced readers copies I had ever gotten and I absolutely loved the first two books! The relationship between Ninian and Aed was so sweet and I was worried as to where the story might go from where it left off, but I think that it was done really well!<br /><br />The Wild Court follows Aed and Ronan after 7 years of ruling The Gut. In our last appearance we saw Aed get crowned, and 7 years later he has earned the respect of the kingdom. Until something unexpected happens at Ronans crowning, drawing out the faerie unrest from across the veil.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book was the found family that gets developed beyond the veil. We don't know where we're going, and there is so much adventure on the way, so the bond between the little group is inevitable. Plus we continue to see the relationship between Aed and Ronan develop, which was so sweet. After their entire lifetimes basically, they are still learning how to get to know each other on a deeper level. I loved the focus on growing and learning about each other so much!<br /><br />I thought the story had list me in the beginning right when I found out it takes place so long after the other two. However I was pleasantly surprised that I was more invested than I thought I'd be pretty early on! I think the time between the other two books really helped make way for what transpires here. If they hadn't spent years without us (as in, the readers, naturally!) I don't think we would have been able to get the depth of understanding between characters like we did. So it ended up paying off!<br /><br />I also thought it was really cool to finally be able to cross the veil and see what is going on in the faerie realm. The world building was wonderful and really cool, I loved being able to go in and see the courtly politics. Especially how everything wove together in the plot twists!<br /><br />Summing it all up:<br />The Wild Court had me hesitant at first, but as I read and started this book I got invested in way more than anticipated.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Thank the Lord that He brought this book to me and the church in our day.", "text": "Thank the Lord that He is still raising up men like Sinclair Ferguson to write a book such as this in our day.<br /><br />If this review is read by Sinclair Ferguson:  I read the first three chapters weeping for joy and resisting the urge to highlight every other sentence.  I am so grateful to God that He led you to write &#34;The Whole Christ.&#34;  I hope to meet you in eternity and thank you face-to-face.<br /><br />To the reader of this review:  I have been a Christian for forty years.  I spent nearly all that time in churches that focused on doctrinal purity, constantly preaching against easy-believism and antinomianism.  I believed that this was the safest place for my soul.  Of course, the Lord was caring for me and His purposes are loving and wise.  In reality, I was deeply spiritually depressed, struggling with assurance, feeling that God as my Father was constantly displeased with me.<br /><br />Eighteen months ago, I left that church for a church that focuses on Christ and the gospel, while maintaining sound doctrine, and without shying-away from preaching against sin.  The strong Gospel focus in this new church (and the joy of the believers here) was utterly new to me.  I found the focus on Christ Himself and His work to be healing to my deep spiritual depression.<br /><br />I praise God that He prepared me in this way to read and appreciate the issues of legalism and antinomianism as doctor Ferguson deals with them in &#34;The Whole Christ.&#34;  It has revived my hope that the Lord is not finished with the church in the English-speaking world.  It is my hope and prayer that God uses this book to lead many pastors to re-evaluate their own understanding and preaching of the gospel.  And may many struggling believers read and understand what it means to be in Christ through reading it and find new measures of joy and usefulness in Christ's kingdom.<br /><br />The historical lead-in to the Marrow controversy is written in a very readable style.  I found myself answering the Auchterarder question, and hesitated to answer, but the lead-in and explanation helps the reader see the profound concern of the author to see why is is so important for today.  (BTW: if you can, don't let anyone describe it to you, read the first chapter and see how you would answer it.)<br /><br />Chapters two and three, were profoundly moving to me.  I am not exaggerating when I relate that I wept before the Lord with the the exposition of the Apostle's creed at the end of chapter two.  It is simply beautiful, and drew me closer to Christ.  I wept when I read the first full paragraph on page 66 (every Christian needs to understand in their heart that God the Father LOVES them, and that He loved them BEFORE Christ died for them, and He does not love them only because Christ died for them!)  Pages 72 and 73 need to be read and taken seriously in every church.<br /><br />I will come back and update this review at a later time after I have read the book through again.<br /><br />May God move others to read and spread this good word.  I believe God will use this book to revive a right understanding of Christ as the gospel offered to sinners, and revive joy and peace in believer's hearts.<br /><br />=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=&#60;&#62;=<br /><br />I finished the book last night and wanted to add a few things.<br /><br />While I my excitement expressed above is sincere, and I really have deeply benefited, YOU may not get the same benefit from reading this book.  Your walk and experience are your own.  You may not have been scarred by legalism, and if so you may not find this as helpful.<br /><br />The book has a lot of material aimed at ministers of the gospel, and some of the material is fairly heavy-duty theology.  I found a few chapters were tough sledding.  However, I hope to come back in a few months and read it again and hopefully gain more understanding.<br /><br />(As a side note, for anyone that is not inclined to heavy-duty theology, you might find the book &#34;Stop Asking Jesus into Your Heart&#34; by JD Greear [[ASIN:1433679213 Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart: How to Know for Sure You Are Saved]] to be more helpful.  It covers much of the same areas but is addressed more to struggling believers.)<br /><br />Chapter eleven has many helpful thoughts on problems with assurance.  I found it very helpful, as were some comments about the joy and peace that a believer can know when problems are cleared away.  Again, very helpful.<br /><br />I will be praying that many ministers of the gospel read this book and search their hearts to see where there may be issues that need to be addressed.", "images": [], "asin": "1433548003", "parent_asin": "1433548003", "user_id": "AEAS2FVY7TVPAEC72GQJ2D3XFOMQ", "timestamp": 1454263233000, "helpful_vote": 23, "verified_purchase": false}

Reading a physics textbook is not an option for me to know more about the subject. The overwhelmed amount of mathematics and statistics involved is too intimidating. This book makes my dream come true. The author is very good in making difficult subjects entertaining to read.

The subject covered ranges from Newtonian physics to Einstein's relativity to quantum theory. Each topic is divided into 1-2 pages sub-topics so the readers will not get lost as they try to understand it. Bear in mind that is book is about conceptual and not applied physics. I found the philosophical chapters not as entertaining to read as the former part.<br /><br />What the book does not tell you: The \"applied\" aspects of physics such as the topics you will find in Hawkin's Universe (singularity, black hole, galaxies) or the Star Trek's stuff (wormhole, anti-matter).

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Not a Total Loss", "text": "At the age of 31, Brent Weeks published this novel during the height of dorks, geeks, and nerds becoming completely intrigued by assassins.  Any gamer will tell you that the video game Assassin's Creed, released in late 2007, was a hit, and the following year this book found its way to the shelves and was snatched up eagerly.  I am almost positive that this fact surely helped the sales as the front of the novel touts a similarly dressed main character to the one from the impressive, groundbreaking video game.<br /><br />To put it obviously, the nearly 700 page novel is about assassins, but not just ANY assassins.  Assassins in the book are actually more scorned upon than anything else as they cannot access something known as the Talent (very creative), which is magical energy that can help disguise the assassin further or aid them in their conquest.  If you have the Talent, you can graduate to the unflattering term of \"wetboy.\"  Assassins have targets, wetboys have deaders suggesting that assassins may fail their target, but wetboys simply don't.  Durzo Blint, the most famous, proficient, and most deadly wetboy in Cenaria City is also the most feared and most used wetboy for contractual deaths.  Azoth, a young slum kid, reveres the wetboy since Durzo does NOT live in fear and Azoth seems to do nothing but fear everything.  Azoth gets a very weak but determined plan to try to get Blint to be his master and train him as a wetboy...for no other reason than his friends and he live in constant fear.  So, uhh, this might give you an idea of how weak the writing is...'cause, well, it is.<br /><br />The writing is a struggle and if I could give this book three and a half stars I would.  It's not from lack of creativity, but Weeks drops you into a world with very limited explanation or helpful guidance and expects you to just understand what the hell a Sa'kage and Shinga and ka'kari are for hundreds of pages until he gets around to explaining it naturally.  Though I appreciate the naturalism of suggesting the world is that realistic, it's hard for a casual reader to just go along for the ride without way too many questions clouding one's concentration.  It reminds me of a very paltry version of George R.R. Martin, but Martin has the years behind him and the writer-wisdom to give you enough to understand early on the simple governmental, cultural, or societal concepts that would be lost otherwise.<br /><br />That aside, it is a pretty great little story that is, from the get-go, quite obviously never intended to be reserved to a single book.  Weeks does have a good sense of voice and creativity with a blunt attitude and sarcasm throughout that is entertaining and refreshing.  He has a broad range of characters that are developed and have rich backstory.  As we follow Azoth under Blint's tutelage, the concepts of creating new identities, the flexibility of having multiple skills in weaponry, poisons, plans, and abilities is utterly staggering and, to be frank, realistic.  The story moves quickly despite the bulky size of the book and keeps you drama-filled and sated with just enough surprise to make it a page turner.<br /><br />Frankly, I wish Weeks had written this ten years later, after having gotten the kinks out of his writing.  Everyone has to start somewhere, though, and his writing is endearing enough to be palatable.  With the ending of the book the way it stands, I'm pretty stoked about the following novels, and at least have a better beat about the world in which he carves his tale.", "images": [], "asin": "0316033677", "parent_asin": "0316033677", "user_id": "AGQ4JE3J3SN57GE46FVLTNL3YPVQ", "timestamp": 1596209336680, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great intro to 1900s music", "text": "This is the only music sheet book for 1900s music I was able to find that is for piano/vocal. Many music sheets from this era are for the chord organ, which is no longer popular today. I bought this for my husband who recently restarted playing piano. He wanted something fun and cheerful to play, along Jeeves & Wooster lines, and not just hard classical music. These songs are perfect - you can sing along and the music is not too difficult. It is also not however, an EZ version that the Hal Leonard company also publishes. Furthermore, from what I can tell on the Hal website, there is no 1900s or 1910s \"Essential Songs Series\" version of the Decade books. If you're planning to buy the 1920s or other decades, you might want to check out both the \"Songs of the 1920s: The Decade Series\" and the \"Essential Songs of the 1920s Series\" to compare which songs you like better. The Essential series tends to have around 100 songs, the Decade around 50 or so. The difference is that the Decade series actually starts off with some historical commentary on the decade, the popular music trends, pictures, etc. The Essential series does not have this. Please note that the Decade commentary is very American focused, and so are some of the songs. However, most popular songs made it to both sides of the Atlantic, so the song content is probably not that much of an issue if you're European. In terms of content, the songs in the Decade and Essential songs overlap to an extent, but not a huge one. In fact, the Decade series tends to have a lot of stuff not in the Essential series. So you might want to buy the two books for each Decade.", "images": [], "asin": "0793531268", "parent_asin": "0793531268", "user_id": "AHNPQBO6QZJ4UNKTGOLF4KLSOMLQ", "timestamp": 1291394641000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Peaceful Mountain Commune with a Dark Underbelly", "text": "The Ash Family is a farming commune in the mountains of North Carolina. Berie is a young woman who doesn't know what she wants and has let her mother and her boyfriend tell her what to do until the moment she leaves for university and decides not to go, turning around and taking a bus to Asheville. At the bus stop, she encounters the charismatic Bay, who brings her to the Ash family farm and where she learns to work with farm animals, and is drawn into the close and tightly controlled group led by Dice, who also leads the inner circle of his group in a little light eco-terrorism. Berie is desperate to be trusted enough to join them and throws herself into the endless tasks involved in pulling a living out of the land. She's also desperate to get time with Bay, who is often gone recruiting new members and desperate to be accepted and find a home within the Ash Family.<br /><br />As Molly Dektar's debut novel goes on, it becomes increasingly clear that the Ash Family is not a benign group and equally clear that the members are being kept under tight control and surveillance. Berie's need for belonging can't entirely hide the less savory aspects of the commune from her, especially as her one friend is protecting a secret and Berie will not be able to remain free of the consequences. And, back in Durham, there are people worried about her and while they might be able to tell her that they want her to come home, whether or not Berie leaves is entirely up to her.<br /><br />While the novel does sometimes feel predictable and research into cults makes itself known, Dektar's writing is strong and clear. Berie is a wonderful character, very much an eighteen year old, but also a young woman who has a moral compass and who develops into someone who knows herself over the course of this novel.", "images": [], "asin": "1501144863", "parent_asin": "1501144863", "user_id": "AHACF3Q5ZK3P7K3YM45KIL2BX2JA", "timestamp": 1555282406057, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Light In The Ruins, Chris Bohjalian", "text": "The book opens in 1955 with the description of the brutal murder of a still good-looking, middle-aged woman, details of which, using italics, are related to the reader by the actual murderer,<br />The story then backpedals to Tuscany, in 1943, to the Villa Chimera, the home of the Marchese and Marchesa, Antonio and Beatrice Rosati, Cristina, their daughter, and their daughter-in-law, Francesca, and her children, Alessia and Massimo. The Rosati sons are both in the Italian army. One, Vittore, works in a museum and the other, Francesca's husband, Marco, is on the front someplace in Italy. Many of the Italians are forced to alternately support the Italian Army or the German Army, depending on the fortunes of war, since Italy was originally aligned with Germany. Although some are not sympathizers with much of the policies of either Mussolini or Hitler, they are still caught, very much in the middle, when their villages or their villas attract the eye and attention of some Italians or Germans in the hierarchy of the military or the government.<br />When the story returns to 1955, we learn that it is Francesca who has been brutally murdered, and we are introduced to Serafina, a former partisan fighter, who had been severely injured, near death, in 1944, at the end of the war, and who is now the only female homicide detective in the police department. She is working on this murder case with Paolo, her partner. For Serafina, the investigation opens the wounds of the past, when she was a young teen, without family, fighting for her life and her freedom, together with the partisans. She has no real memory of how she was so gravely injured, but since she was in the forest near the Rosati property, she wonders if there could be a connection there, to her past.<br />As she interviews Cristina, we learn that she was visiting her sister-in-law for lunch in Florence, where she once conducted a rather amorous and illicit affair with a German soldier, Friedrich, who worked with her brother in the museum in Florence. This led to a rather colorful and malicious reputation for herself and her family. Currently, however, she resides in Rome with the Marchesa. The fictional villa, in Tuscany, where the family once lived and housed the Germans, is no longer really habitable, and there is neither the money required to restore it or the desire to do so, but it is an important link to all that occurs in the story. Since the villa was, and is now, in an even worse state of disrepair, and since it is associated with too much loss and too much tragedy for the family and townspeople, who have mixed feelings toward them because of their wartime behavior, the decision not to return was not a very difficult one.<br />When the story returns to the italics in which the murderer's ultimate goal is revealed, there is enormous tension created for the reader. Even though the murderer is informing the reader of future plans to destroy every last, living member of the Rosati family, rather than boring or disappointing the reader, since they now know the ultimate plot, it seems that just knowing this information only seems to make the narrative more exciting and the solution to the mystery more inaccessible. So, although I found it a bit unnerving when the murderer related his plans, the foreknowledge certainly heightened my anticipation of events to come, and although I tried to solve the mystery of who the killer might be, until the last few pages, my guesses were all misguided! This author has the gift of keeping the reader on the edge of the seat, wanting to hurriedly turn the next page to discover a clue to solve the mystery, only to be maddeningly led in another plausible direction.<br />As the story moves back and forth between the past, 1943 and eventually 1944, and the present (1955) murder investigation, the author portrays events that changed the lives of the Italians, during the war. He reveals the madness of Hitler and Mussolini, exposing the fierceness of the military, the violence, destruction and cruelty of the times, but he never avoids pointing out that the Italians were complicit in their own destruction for they supported the axis powers, whom I can only refer to as maniacal megalomaniacs.<br />The war was perceived by all of the participants differently: the Partisans, the Italians, the Nazis, the Blackshirts, all had a different idea of what they were fighting for and how to go about it. Each had little choice in the path chosen. Some were forced by the Germans to obey, others by the Italians and still others by the Partisans or the pressure of peers who disagreed or agreed at great peril to their own lives. Disobedience probably meant an uncertain and very painful death, sometimes with cause and sometimes merely as an example to others to not betray those that were in charge. Morality, Ethics, right and wrong, simply did not appear to be a major part of the equation, rather it was the need to survive or protect the security of others.<br />As in so many of his other books, Bohjalian uses history as an underlying theme and illustrates the murderous behavior of despots during wartime. He shines a light on the forces of evil that force good people to sometimes compromise their souls to save themselves or their loved ones. Underlying the murder theme is also a romantic one; there are perhaps two or even three love stories, all of which have a devastating effect on the way that the narrative turns. As always, the author refrains from using gratuitous sex as a device, and instead, uses his skill to keep the reader guessing, wondering who the murderer was going to be, what were the \"six degrees of separation\" that connected the characters, and how would it all end. He simply keeps pointing in one direction or another, each one perhaps more plausible and each one a maneuver to misdirect you, oh so effectively! If you want a good mystery, look no further.", "images": [], "asin": "0385534817", "parent_asin": "0385534817", "user_id": "AGFOMHRBKJKIMBPBJT4VQF3LZAMQ", "timestamp": 1375471056000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Not that hard to read paper pulp paper so many time found in travel guides.The guide is over 392 pages and I found contains all the information I needed to plan my trip. While I have been to Cancun and the Yucatan several times I learned from this guide about many places and activities that interest me.The guide is broken down into easy to read and follow sections such as \"The Best Of The Yucatan , Tabasco & Chiapas\" section.There are suggested itineraries and a little help at the end of the book on Spanish and mayan terms and phrases.There is an excellent pull out map in the back of the guide and many area and sectional maps in color throughout the guide. In addition there are dozens of color photos located throughout the guide. While restaurants and hotels are listed I find I can locate a much more extensive list on the internet.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "a romantic adventure that's hard to put down", "text": "A very romantic novel set in Regency London is not my usual type of read, but Sarah MacLean has such a magical way with words, I'm going to make an effort to change this.  I started reading The Season when I really didn't have time to settle in with a book--and was hard pressed to put it down.<br /><br />The Season is a very engrossing story about a feisty seventeen-year-old, Lady Alexandra Stafford, and her two best friends, Ellie and Vivi, as they prepare for their first season.  It's time to get married!  No matter how much you don't want to.  And Alex?  So doesn't want to.  She's more set on adventure and not being tied down for the rest of her life.  And though she makes it abundantly clear she has no interest whatsoever in snagging a husband and kissing fun goodbye, she still must endure the balls and dinner parties and an ever-growing list of suitors.<br /><br />More preoccupying than those, however, are the strange new feelings she's developed for her old friend, Gavin.  Gavin's father, The Earl of Blackmoor, recently died in an accident that's looking a little less accidental every day, and before she knows it, Alex finds herself caught up in a mystery so dangerous that marriage becomes the least of her problems.<br /><br />The Season is a clever, engaging, romantic romp.  I loved the tension between Alex and Gavin and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see whether the (mis)adventures that befell them would bring them closer together or tear them apart.  One of my favourite aspects about this book was that the biggest obstacles facing their complicated relationship were often of their own making.  Alex and Gavin question their feelings for each other in a refreshing way that doesn't turn into a frustrating He Said/She Said.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed the mystery and the way Alex & Co. chose to handle the events that transpired.  It felt very realistic to me.  The tight friendship between Alex, Vivi and Ellie was one of my favourite dynamics in this story;  these are strong women with admirable qualities who complement each other nicely and their banter is snappy and fun.<br /><br />MacLean's prose is rich and transportive.  I loved her attention to detail;  from the balls, to who was wearing what.  I get lost easily, but I felt like I was there and picturing it all perfectly thanks to her ability to bring the time to life.<br /><br />A delightful read.", "images": [], "asin": "0545048869", "parent_asin": "0545048869", "user_id": "AGONJ2COTSMJCA2JOPL5IXSC3D2A", "timestamp": 1246842083000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A Departure from Classic Franey", "text": "I always enjoyed watching Mr. Franey's TV cooking show. So when I thumbed through this book at a friend's house, I decided to buy a copy for myself. Only then did I realize how \"fat phobic\" it was. This book was written during one of the dreariest decades in America's culinary history; when everyone tried to remove all traces of butter, cream, oil and flavor from the food. I look back through my cooking magazines from the 90's and see the same dismal trends. It was a period when Americans blamed fat in the diet for their bulging waistlines, and went about filling their grocery carts with cans, boxes and frozen foods labeled \"low fat.\" Amazingly, obesity has skyrocketed rather than decreased since then. We failed to realize that deep-frying aside, carbohydrates and sugars, which are consumed in massive amounts daily, are the true culprits. But I digress. I guess the pretty pictures in this book seduced me because the recipes themselves seem rather bothersome with very little pay-off. It makes no sense to take a classic French recipe and strip it of its soul. Just eat something else and enjoy the classic on a special occasion. One can enjoy ALL things in moderation. I haven't tried any of the recipes and I probably won't. I just don't salivate at the thought of eating everything cooked in or served in a broth. I am not an invalid. A note, assuring the reader that there is very little or no fat in it, accompanies practically every recipe. It's fat-fear-over-kill. Artists, and chefs are artists, should never cave in or bow to public fads and manias. The book is well written and beautifully photographed. It looks good on my coffee table.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Timeless tales review", "text": "By TT reviewer Laurie Alice Eakes [Full review on our website]<br />Married By Mistake is the delightful story of Gabrielle Alexandra Lynn-Edred and Dante Werian, Marquess of Edenvale. Gabrielle, otherwise known as Stormy, is a spirited beautiful young woman who has been unjustly accused and jailed for the crime of attempted suicide. Dante is the young nobleman who, by chance, happens to come upon her in a desperate time of need. Upon finding themselves in difficult circumstances, Dante and Gabrielle decide that the only option left open to them is marriage. What is supposed to be a marriage of convenience and a marriage in name only takes a twist as Gabrielle and Dante find that they can not deny the feelings that they have for one another.<br />Although their feelings are strong for each other, there are other outside forces that throw up obstacles to their relationship. Gabrielle's Uncle and guardian has made it appear to the outside world that she is an insane young woman when nothing could be farther from the truth. He plans to control her finances through her supposed insanity. Dante's parents stand in their way as well. These are two people who hold considerable power and can be very ruthless when crossed. Through it all, Dante and Gabrielle must learn to see through the half-truths and rumors in order to finally be able to trust in their love for each other. Only when they realize that sometimes decisions that may seem like a mistake at the time have a way of turning out for the best, will they be able to find a love that will last for a lifetime.<br />I found this book to be a delight. As the hero and heroine of the story, Dante and Gabrielle were wonderful. They weren't content to just wait for fate to deal her hand but took actions of their own. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys any type of a historical romance.", "images": [], "asin": "1931696764", "parent_asin": "1931696764", "user_id": "AFIMJGTQQG3FSDA37WZI4UFMPYIQ", "timestamp": 1032055669000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A North Vietnamese soldier road-trips through war-torn jungle to help a friend and make an uneasy home visit after 10yrs at war", "text": "This novel\u2019s protagonist, Quan, is a North Vietnamese soldier who, after ten years of war-fighting and surviving, has worked his way up to a junior officer position with a small unit under his command. Much of the story describes a road trip in the midst of war. One of Quan\u2019s childhood friends who is now his superior officer, Luong, assigns Quan the task of going to visit a distant medical unit to check on a third common village friend, Bien, who is said to have had a nervous breakdown.  Luong, further tells Quan to take some well-earned time off for a home visit, since the junior officer hasn\u2019t been to see his home in a decade.  In the latter part of the book, Quan returns to his unit after an uneasy home visit to see the father with whom he has strained relations (his mother ran away with another man), the neighbors he seems closer to than he is his own father, and his childhood sweetheart who has fallen on hard times -- having had to accept that the two would never be married.  On the way, back to his unit, Quan checks on Bien who he busted out of horrific conditions at a field hospital and got reassigned to a special unit with the non-Infantry, but macabre, task of building coffins. The book ends with another uneasy transition, the war\u2019s end \u2013 which sees Quan\u2019s comrades in celebration, but also not sure what to expect after an entire adult life spent at war.<br /><br />Interspersed with the real-time events that occur as Quan travels through a jungle war-zone, one is shown flashbacks to some of the intense traumas of his years at war.  These include friendly-fire incidents and the \u201conly the good die young\u201d effect in which it seems the most kind and virtuous are often the most perishable in times of war. There\u2019s also a very human story that\u2019s told about how war effects lives and transforms relationships \u2013 in some cases forging unbreakable bonds and in other cases building impenetrable barriers between loved ones.<br /><br />I\u2019ve read a few books on the Vietnam War, both fiction and non-fiction, but this may be the first I\u2019ve read from a North Vietnamese perspective. What is interesting about that is that the experiences and themes are often not that different than one sees in works like Karl Marlantes\u2019s \u201cMatterhorn\u201d or Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cThe Things They Carried.\u201d Soldiers on both sides have similar day-to-day experiences from boredom to horrors, and it has largely the same effect upon the soldier\u2019s psyches. One of the overarching themes this book has in common with its American-centric counterparts is growing disillusionment. Like the American soldiers who often couldn\u2019t comprehend what they were fighting for (other than the survival of their friends and themselves), Quan\u2019s core beliefs become challenged over the course of the novel. It\u2019s often been said that there are no atheists in foxholes, but it seems equally true that there are no ideologues in foxholes. The pragmatic concerns demanded of the war-fighter make it hard to be an impassioned Marxist or an impassioned follower of any ideology. This is seen in one scene in which an older officer is put off by Quan\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the Marxist message, and then later when the tables are turned and Quan converses with a young subordinate soldier who is even more disillusioned.<br /><br />Of course, there are differences. Quan is much more at home in the environment of the war \u2013 though not exempt from the miseries of the jungle.  It\u2019s not like he\u2019s been dropped on a different planet as it was for American soldiers who had no experience of tropical living. On the other hand, an American soldier could at least rest assured that his loved one\u2019s were home in safety, but for Quan and his peers there is no reason to think family is any more safe than they. Of course, the concept of traipsing through the war zone on a home visit after years successively at war represents one important difference that is also fundamental to the story.<br /><br />I found this book to be gripping and illuminating. It\u2019s highly readable and relatable, even though there are flashbacks that take one out of a linear timeline; they are well done and not confusing. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who reads war stories, who enjoys translated fiction from other cultures, or who just wants a thought-provoking work of literary fiction.", "images": [], "asin": "0140255109", "parent_asin": "0140255109", "user_id": "AE6KA6ORMSRMC4GESVHR7GNIPFPQ", "timestamp": 1528268344207, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Exciting chase in modern China", "text": "It's one of those books that I read in one setting.  There's action in every city in China that the main character, Ellie, enters.  Brackmann, the author, does a remarkable job capturing the modern flavor of China from a Westerner's perspective - one that has 'white tile disease', hired online gamers, a lavish conceptual art party on the crumbling Great Wall, and a populace scrambling after their own interests.  Her flashbacks of Iraq are palpably hot and sandy and does an equal job portraying the gritty human nature of Americans.  She punctuates this with the Christian hypocritical subtext that dots the length of the story.<br /><br />Brackmann interweaves China's big-brother enforcement, inflated demand for its contemporary art, and its online gaming community with the US' abuses in Iraq.  She does this successfully as she has her heroine, Ellie, chased by both US and Chinese agents in this foreign action novel tied in with flashbacks to the war in Iraq.<br /><br />The story is told in first person, by Ellie, who curses often and is portrayed as a 26 year old woman of lower class origins.  Yet the strong narrative belies the voice of the educated, more experienced author and resonates more convincingly of a college educated expat than an ignorant young woman following her husband.  With a solid action sequence full of interesting characters, I end the book confused as to why exactly she was being chased and by whom at each moment.  Ellie's relationship with Trey unfolds through the story and portrays a complex history whereas her relationship with Lao Zhang receives unsatisfactorily topical treatment given her loyalty and the story plot.  Similarly, the online characters are left mysterious in either identity and/or involvement.<br /><br />Altogether, Brackmann does an enticing job describing a dynamic and corrupt China that coincides with my own experiences and impressions of the country.  She is able to weave an exciting action story with an unlikely heroine although the ending left me wanting a fuller explanation.", "images": [], "asin": "1569479518", "parent_asin": "1569479518", "user_id": "AGBT4JCG5XXPBSUBWYZG57OTKHZQ", "timestamp": 1312846362000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "More entertaining than I expected", "text": "I bought THE BLUE STREAK in 1987.  I've just now gotten around to reading it.  Too bad I waited because this is an action-packed book.<br /><br />In chapter one when multi-millionaire John Marigold wants to hire the Blue Streak to save his also-rich niece, Bess, from making a fool of herself investing in some scheme of a man named Count Luggar.  Marigold thinks every man has his price, but the Blue Streak isn't interested.  He meets Bess and the Count on the way out.  The count has a dapper little mustache and bothers to wax the ends into points.  How suspicious!  Bess is a gray-eyed blonde with an arrogant air.  In all of the illustrations in which she appears she's dressed for riding so she's wearing a snood.  From the neck up Bess looks as if she wandered over from LITTLE WOMEN.  As we learn later though, she's not the type to swoon when she's in danger.  She knows how to box!<br /><br />The Blue Streak doesn't change his mind when he meets her.  It takes a bullet hitting him in his bullet-proof vest to do that.<br /><br />Doctor Medusa is Marigold's physician, despite his ominous name.  We learn more about our lead villain in chapter two.  His own gang members are cold-blooded killers, but they're afraid of him.  His utter ruthlessness becomes clear when one of the gang asks a foolish question.<br /><br />Marigold has been kidnapped by chapter three.  The Blue Streak doesn't go after him alone.  He has a loyal mechanic for a sidekick.  Hank O'Toole keeps our hero's light plane and his speedster, the torpedo, going.  (The torpedo can go over 100 mph -- that's almost 161 kph.)  The Blue Streak and Hank take the torpedo to Count Luggar's lodge in the Skeleton Mountains, a place well known for people getting lost and never being seen again.  There's an attempt to kill our heroes off before they even get there.  Marigold is rescued, but Bess has been twit enough to be the Count's guest.<br /><br />How will the Blue Streak infiltrate this den of evil?  By lucky chance, a bond salesman heading to the lodge to make a big sale meets with an accident.  By even luckier chance, his clothes fit the hero.<br /><br />Bess likes the handsome \"Alan Gibbs\" enough to irritate Count Luggar.  Too bad that Luggar's enormous butler, Midge, fails to break \"Gibb's\" neck.  Now Luggar is forced to arrange a fatal hunting \"accident\" for his rival and Bess.<br /><br />The Blue Streak and Bess survive.  They have some bad moments in one of the Skeleton Mountains' many caves.  We're also treated to a glimpse of Dr. Medusa's underground city and why his name is appropriate.  It does explain why Luggar had to make sure that Bess and \"Alan\" weren't disfigured during the attempted murder.  Dr. Medusa is a classic mad scientist.  Even he knows he's certifiable.  Love his tricks and traps.<br /><br />The rescued get kidnapped again.  There's more underground peril that nearly gets the Blue Streak and Hank killed.  Can they save John and Bess Marigold from having their wealth and lives stolen?  Will Dr. Medusa let himself be taken alive?<br /><br />There is no explanation for why the Blue Streak is so strong, can see in the dark, and has superhuman hearing.  His real name is never given.  What we know of his background comes from the beginning of chapter three.  He didn't inherit much money, but we're told he doesn't need much.  Really?  I think a man with his vehicles who can afford to dress as if he's wealthy and to eat a thick steak in a fashionable nightclub while he's checking things out probably needs more than a little money.  Still, that claim is more believable than this one from chapter four:  \"His muscles tensed and bulged under the tight-fitting red trousers which allowed him full freedom of action.\"  This is 1946.  Spandex hasn't been invented yet.<br /><br />The Blue Streak might have been an original character.  My old Whitman authorized editions usually state what comic strip they're based on, but this one doesn't.  It doesn't matter.  I sure had fun with this book.  I also like the illustrations, although the proportions sometimes seem a little off.", "images": [], "asin": "B0007ESWOK", "parent_asin": "B0007ESWOK", "user_id": "AFEUT7QRQW4LIYLMJ7FYBO4DL32A", "timestamp": 1335203309000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

While the book is engrossing and quite well-written, every single story is disturbing, depressing, fear-inducing, gruesome, or some combination of those four adjectives. Spoiler alert!!!! There is more than one story depicting the horrifying loss of a child, which is of course not something many parents want to read about. There is a truly disgusting story about a debarking machine, from which I learned something about the logging industry I'd rather have remained ignorant to. I am not afraid of a sad story, especially if it seems to have a point, but all of these stories served no purpose, had no lessons, no climax, no interesting characters, nothing - just sadness.", "images": [], "asin": "0156034441", "parent_asin": "0156034441", "user_id": "AGPRTDDOT4TEIKPTHQ4R7NHIM4DQ", "timestamp": 1324099687000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Iced Chiffon definitely takes on a new meaning in this book!", "text": "Reagan Summerside is always scrambling to make ends meet. Since her messy divorce from Hollis Beaumont III, she's sold everything she can get her hands on in order to keep from losing her beloved Cherry House, the Victorian that they had bought together and she's put all kinds of blood, sweat and tears into renovating it, not to mention her money. When she and Aunt KiKi find the body of her ex's fiancee, Janelle and he's arrested for the murder, Reagan knows she has to work extra hard and ever harder than Hollis's lawyer to solve the case. She's afraid she'll lose Cherry House if Hollis is convicted.<br /><br />With all the selling that she's doing, somehow inadvertently a consignment shop named the Prissy Fox is born from Reagan's downstairs. In scrounging for her own nice clothes to resell, people would start talking about the place and start to bring their own clothes in to resell. It also didn't hurt that the murder victim was found outside Reagan's house, lots of interest just coming to the house.<br /><br />While investigating and listening to the local gossip, freely supplied by her aunt and various people in town, she finds out that a lot of people had a reason to want Janelle dead. If she doesn't hurry up and find the killer, she may find herself dead as well!<br /><br />This was a book that I could barely put down. I just had to keep reading and finding out what was going on. Not only was it hilarious in places, I just really enjoyed the characters, especially Aunt KiKi. She was such a hoot! It was so funny how she'd trade favors with Reagan and grudgingly go along on a sleuthing mission but then end up all interested in it after all. I liked all the little side mysteries, like all the people seemingly had secrets they needed to keep hidden. I also really enjoy any mystery that is set in the South. I can always picture the gorgeous homes and their landscapes.<br /><br />I'd be missing out on a great character if I didn't mention BW aka Bruce Willis, the stray dog that showed up underneath Reagan's porch and quickly squirmed his way into her heart. BW got to play a pretty good part in the take down as well. I really didn't see this conclusion coming at all, was totally surprised by the reveal. I had suspected a couple of people but kind of abandoned that after awhile. The one I thought did it was definitely not the killer.<br /><br />I will be reading the rest of this series! Reagan acts like she hates the lawyer of Hollis's but he bailed her out of some situations so I have a feeling she might start liking him eventually.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent Mystery - Great education on Indian Culture", "text": "Tulip Season: A Mitra Basu Mystery by Bharti Kirchner takes you along for a ride with it's star Mitra as she searches for her missing best friend.  Unlike most \"mystery\" books out there, this book has a true realism about it that makes you feel like you are in the story.  Not prone to romantic/typical mystery notions, Bharti Kirchner has written a story that introduces you easily into Indian culture as well as keeps you on your toes as you read along to find the \"end\" to the mysterious disappearance of Mitra's friend.<br /><br />I found the story idea/plot to be a great choice, but at times was a little confused by the descriptions, the excessive look into the culture and the lack of \"mystery\".  Not typical, yet not a bad book.  It was very educational (surprising) and gave me a new look into a culture I am fairly familiar with.  As far as a mystery, detective or sleuth book - it was mediocre at best.  The mystery to me was easily solved and the book itself was much more about the main character and her daily life, past and how she dealt with her upbringing and ethnic culture.<br /><br />Bharti Kirchner does indeed have a great way with words and makes excellent descriptions of locations and scenes.  Her writing is simple yet not without finesse.  I see potential in her writing as she hones her story development skills in coming books.  I do look forward to reading her again in the future and see where she takes this character Mitra Basu.", "images": [], "asin": "1935961470", "parent_asin": "1935961470", "user_id": "AH6DIUPDMG4E4ZXU5ESE5QY2SH7A", "timestamp": 1343859569000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

As I started reading I did not think I was into it. But I also read 200 pages on the day I picked it up, so clearly I was into it. This book very quickly pulls you in.<br />The novel is told in the \u201cvoice\u201d of a 5 year old narrator, and it is a clever device. However, it gets really old and a little annoying after a while. Perhaps the author could have broken up the point of view every couple of chapters? I don\u2019t know what would have been better, I really don\u2019t. But I do know that at times while reading the novel I really hated constantly being inside a 5 year old mind, and I began to dislike Jack (the narrator) by the end of the book. Not the intended point I\u2019m sure.<br />Towards the end of part 4 of the novel, called \u201cAfter\u201d, there is a scene that is unrealistic and just ridiculous with Jack and his uncle and aunt. It comes across as cheap and completely implausible, and the rest of the text does not feel that way, so it is glaring to the reader.<br />Mostly however the text is filled with many suspenseful and powerful moments and there are times when it is even profound. For instance Jack has some really interesting thoughts about the concept of Time. It coming from a child\u2019s perspective lends it even greater poignancy.<br />\u201cRoom\u201d is divided into two structural halves, each one consisting of two parts and I liked that structure. Both sections are intense, in different ways, and their focus gives a break from the focus of the other half. A book that was devoted to only one of the two parts of the book would have been too much for the reader.<br />This was a book club choice.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Two sickly twisted chapbooks in one", "text": "The Pig:  If you're faint of heart, put this book down now!  'The Pig' is a viscous tale of junkies, bestiality, sodomy, scat, necrophilia, and snuff ... Edward Lee at his grossest.  Filmmaker wanna-be Leonard, after a horrible stint in prison, steals his previous boss's filmmaking equipment and heads to New York to make it big.  He just needs four thousand dollars, and winds out borrowing from the wrong man, mob-boss Rocco.  When he can't pay back the loan, he's beaten and divorced from one of his testicles, and forced to work for the mob as their filmmaker, creating masterpieces of animal-human carnality, brutality, gore, and much worse.  Things culminate to a mystical and demonic ending when a pig is brought in by Rocco for Leonard's films.  Warning: this piece is very graphic.  On another note, Leonard's original piece that he wished to make into his first film, titled 'The Confessor' is in this story, and it's a very good piece of work.  I wonder if it really is an early piece of Lee's.<br /><br />The House:  While fine as a stand-alone story, 'The House' is actually a sequel to 'The Pig'.  It's 23 years later, after the incidents Leonard went through at the mob's hideaway house.  Introvert Melvin is assigned to write a story for his newspaper on the \"old haunted house\", and his glamorously sexy, yet ditzy, young stepmother Gwyneth travels with him.  Despite the stories he's heard from his boss, a drugged out hooker, and even the county sheriff, Melvin still doesn't believe in haunted houses.  Until things begin to go terribly wrong for both him and Gwyneth.  It's not just images that begin to haunt Melvin, but bizarre urges and radio broadcasts from the 1970's.  Then, when Melvin notices Gwyneth going off the deep end in the most depraved ways, he understands that there's more to the tales of haunting than meets the eye.  But is it too late for the two of them to break away from The House's grasp?<br /><br />'The Pig' definitely out-grossed 'The House', in my humble opinion, but 'The House' contained more creeping \"look over your shoulder\" horror than 'The Pig'.  These are not stories for the weaker constitutions; these are tales worthy of the gross out readings at the horror conventions.  You won't be licking your lips after reading this novel, you'll be washing your hands over and over again.  Gross and gory, Edward Lee delivers what he does best, hardcore horror in a handbag filled with scat.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Skip and Go to the Scholarship Instead", "text": "I hate to say it, but this is the sort of volume that gives self-publishing a bad name. It's full of bad practice. Citations are rarely provided. Sweeping claims about general opinion are made throughout without further evidence (incredibly, the author sometimes even provides block quotes without citations). The author definitely seems to be missing a formal background in some of the fields that would be required for an analysis like this (for example, historical linguistics). Images are dropped in from who knows where. Some of these images likely violate copyright. It's unfortunately a mess.<br /><br />Then there's the central claim: The central premise of this small book is that the reading of Proto-Germanic *Nerthuz is &#34;unscientific&#34; and that the form should be *Hertha. The author blames Jacob Grimm for this. However, the author neglects to mention that Grimm was an important\u2014even iconic\u2014philologist. Grimm's Law, which describes crucial elements of the development of Proto-Germanic from Proto-Indo-European and marked the development linguistics as a science (!), for example, is named after him. As this book obviously isn't aimed at an academic audience, all of this would be nice for the reader to know before throwing around terms like &#34;unscientific&#34;.<br /><br />While the field has certainly developed since Grimm, the romantic *Hertha construction has been near universally rejected in academia for over 150 years ago now. Simply take a look at the three major handbooks on the topic in English today (by scholars Rudolf Simek, John Lindow, and Andy Orchard). As was evident then, so is evident now: the existence of the Old Norse form Njordr\u2014which is in fact exactly the form one would expect to develop from Proto-Germanic *Nerthuz\u2014isn't some sort of wild coincidence based on a guess, nor is it anything but overwhelmingly accepted in modern academia.<br /><br />Better to invest your time reading the works of scholars on the topic.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "A dystopian read with an intriguing premise.", "text": "I was intrigued by the unique premise of An Ocean of Minutes and by the publisher's comparison with The Time Traveler's Wife and Station Eleven. A dystopian tale, little time travel and a love story that asks, &#34;can true love stand the test of time?&#34; Yes please!<br /><br />Buuuuut, the similarities between the three books is weak.  Yes, there's a flu pandemic (Station Eleven) and yes there's time travel (Time Traveler's Wife) but that's where the connections end. I wanted to feel more energy, heartache, passion and the danger of a new world.<br /><br />I found myself slowly becoming invested in the book with its descriptions of the post-apocalyptic world and needing to see how things would pan out for the couple. But I had issues with Polly and Frank.  I didn't feel the love between them. A little dysfunctional codependence, sure. But a sweeping romance to stand the test of time? Nope. I wanted to crawl inside their relationship to understand what they were giving up, but the reader is kept at arms' length with Polly, Frank and the secondary characters. As a main character, Polly is rather dull, emotionless and quickly goes from initially trying to find Frank in her new world, to half-hearted attempts to find him to apathy which was more than a little frustrating.<br /><br />While it wasn't all rainbows and unicorns for me this time out, there were parts I enjoyed and found this to be an easy read.  Lim has a fantastic premise and I applaud her for how she incorporated issues of immigration, migration and class structure into her story.  But with more romance, a stronger dystopian vibe and more connection to the characters I would have given this book a higher rating.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This Advanced Reading Copy (ARC) was generously provided by the publisher in exchange for my honest review.", "images": [], "asin": "1501192558", "parent_asin": "1501192558", "user_id": "AFIDNJPKWQAS5TG2AE73IRW7OTGQ", "timestamp": 1531266548922, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Normandy Invasion", "text": "\"I realized that the greatest drama here is not the event but the raw and frightening uncertainty for everyone involved.\" So states Jeff Shaara in his introduction to the second volume in his WWII trilogy, and wow, did he ever come through! Though the events of this horrendous war have been chewed over for more than half a century, Shaara brings a sense of immediacy to his recounting that stimulates genuine anxiety in the reader. He's definitely hit his stride as historical novelist, bringing together painstaking research with his considerable skills at dramatization.<br /><br />The Steel Wave covers the period from January to September, 1944, beginning with the planning of D-day and ending with the Allies' success at driving the Germans from France. Shaara alternates between action scenes involving the fighting men and their generals, and strategic sessions involving the higher ups, most notably Churchill, Eisenhower, Montgomery, and Patton for the Allies, and Rommel for the Nazis. Even Hitler makes the occasional appearance. The author's admiration for Rommel, who fought with honor for his country while despising Hitler, is obvious, and probably justified. Similarly, Shaara illustrates the delicate balancing act performed by Eisenhower as he coordinated American and British staff officers and juggled American and British political demands. Having watched all the old WWII movies, it's easy to shrug off the Normandy invasion as perfectly planned and executed, but having read this book, your comfortable assumptions are blown to bits. Very little went as planned, and the men who fought this campaign carried on in the face of mind-boggling, unforeseen obstacles.<br /><br />What Shaara does best is encapsulate the experience of the soldiers. As his father did in The Killer Angels, in which provided the most incredible description of an artillery bombardment that I've ever read, the son now does for Omaha Beach and its grueling aftermath. \"... Screaming wails, the air above them ripped and shattered. The shells began to thunder above them, jolting him, the men tumbling again, more dust, the concrete shaking, deafening blasts. He lay flat, held his helmet to his head, curled his legs in tight, felt himself bouncing on the concrete, his hands hard on his ears, his brain screaming into the roar of fire, the terror grabbing him, pulling him into a complete and perfect hell.\" When these guys, those who survived the landing, hit the beach, they were soaking wet and really scared, and it's been said that men were dying at the rate of one every six seconds. And yet they prevailed, in the air, on the sea, and on the land, in the face of everything Rommel could throw at them.<br /><br />The Steel Wave makes the battles, and those who fought them, come alive. No dry facts, maps, and figures here. We must not ever forget those who won this war, and those who read this book are in no danger of that.", "images": [], "asin": "0345461398", "parent_asin": "0345461398", "user_id": "AGFITSRY2XD4C25USUA6677FCUZQ", "timestamp": 1297558225000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "opened my eyes to the possibility of travel to places I never imagined", "text": "When you travel do you try to make your way off the well traveled path and the glitzy tourist traps?  Is the purpose of your travel to find new adventure, get to know new people and ways of life, try new  foods, learn about traditions and enjoy the celebration of new cultures? The author of Catch Me if You Can, Jessica Nabongo, was fortunate enough to leave her 9 to 5 corporate job and travel to the 195 official UN -recognized countries (She actually had a head start and Japan was #10 on her list).  She started off her adventures by spending a year teaching English in Japan.  As a Black woman, as she proudly describes herself, she stood out in Japan where the population is more than 95 per cent Japanese. She felt isolated until she learned the language. Along the way she  tells the reader she learned to purposely wander off the beaten path and find authentic experiences. She experienced Tokyo (which she describes as Times Square on steroids) , Osaka, Mount Fuji, Hiroshima, many of the 2,000 temples and shrines of Kyoto but also the lesser known cities and side streets near where she taught. She enjoyed the street food and in home Japanese/American dinners ( octopus balls) with her colleagues. When she left she moved to London for a Master 's program for international development at the London School of Economics.  Her intent was to travel for 3 years before returning home.  It became 7. This book tells of the 100 countries that impacted her the most. Some of them she visited more than 5 times to take in more of the \"vibes\" of the country that had found a special place in her heart. She shares stories and pictures of the people she met, the celebrities and the average citizens.  She shares pictures and stories of some well known tourist sites as well as pictures from off the beaten path: a temple amid cherry blossoms in Japan and a Balinese Hindu temple, a mosque in Iran, murals painted on the walls of many building in Honduras, the feluccas (traditional wooden sailing boats) along the Nile, the Zims (motorcycle taxis) in Benin, the blue dome of St. Peter's Basilica, an agricultural worker in Ethiopia, a dhow (a  traditional boat) on the Indian Ocean off the coast of Kenya, the chief of a Maasai village, the buzzing streets of Haiti, monks in Laos lined up for the food offered to them during Tak bat (almsgiving), an 80 year old grandma spinning wool in Peru, men playing dominoes on a street in Cuba,  St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow's Red Square, Nungwi ( a beach in Zanzibar that is now on her list of the top 5 beaches in the world), a rooftop view of the medina of Tunis in Tunisia, Maya ruins, stilt fishermen in Sri Lanka, the Mass Games in North Korea and more.  She shares little known facts: the saliva of giraffes in Nairobi are antiseptic,  Kyrgystan has roughly the same number of sheep as people, and good times to travel  She tells of \"must visit places and foods to try: an art gallery in Bamako, Mali, the sweet, sour, salt and spicy blend of taste in Burmese cuisine, Sua, a giant Samoan swimming hole that is 100 foot deep,  the 520 feet Punakha Suspension Bridge in Bhutan, must eat street foods and so much more.<br />  I highly recommend this travel guide/diary of 409 pages and numerous pictures, insert maps and advice.

Running from the mid-seventies to 1990, this is a tour through Reagan's America and its somnambulistic abandonment of every value that makes America great.  Once again, Auster usefully blurs the boundaries of autobiography and fiction, making his unlikely tale feel real.  And his choice of a \"mystery story\" setup and personal tone are perfect: with its largely undramatized sequences presented in the casual, reflective style of a memoir, it never gets preachy despite its political intent; and our desire to uncover the mystery of just how and why Ben died pulls us effortlessly through the labyrinth to the end.  For me, the final scene was remarkably touching.

The Nightingale is not a story of defeat but a story of transcendence.  Personifying the women of the Resistance, Vianne and Isabelle open our eyes to the sacrifices made for survival. Left behind by the men who fought for freedom, these sisters take two different paths but learn:  \u201cIn love we find out what we want to be; in war we find out who we are.\u201d  Hannah\u2018s control of detail and emotive language enables us to empathize with Isabella and Vianne as they struggle to survive the atrocities of WWII.<br /><br />The resistance of these sisters during WW II propels us through the narration. Through Vianne, we become observers of the physical, emotional, and psychological challenges inflicted on the women of Carriveau as the war drags them through a quagmire of cruelty and survival.  When Vianne must prepare for her first winter alone with her daughter, Sophie, she realizes \u201chow perilously balanced her survival was\u201d as she begins to chop wood.  \u201cEvery chop reverberated up her arms and lodged painfully in the muscles of her shoulders.  Sweat squeeze from her pores, dampened her hair.\u201d  Although a minute detail of daily survival skills, this metaphorically describes the relentless power of war that overwhelmed her town.<br /><br />At times it is difficult to tell who is narrating the story because the lives of the sisters are intertwined in their stories of survival.  Although fictional, Hannah captures the suffering and bravery of the women of the Resistance in this story.  Years after the war, Vianne observes \u201chow gently time passes in Paris.  As lively as the city is, there\u2019s a stillness to it, a peace that lures you in.  In Paris, with a glass of wine in your hand, you can just be.\u201d  She has survived but at a cost.<br /><br />This novel details a war that most of us don\u2019t remember.  In the world today, Isabelle\u2019s understanding is a lesson we should take to heart: \u201cThey couldn\u2019t touch my heart.  They couldn\u2019t change who I was inside.

It's unusual, both in format and content. There's nothing I like better than taking a tour of someone's house. Reading this is exactly like that, although I'm pretty sure this guy has far more unusual items than the rest of us.<br /><br />Alfred Crabtree has lost his false teeth. After a brief and fruitless search, he starts to organize all his belongings on the advice of his sister. Not only does Alfred has some very odd items, he also has some interesting methods of categorization. I found Alfred to be extremely compelling only five pages in, where he displays his collection of real ducks and decoys (including six spare eyeballs). And I knew we could be friends when I stumbled across his very large collection of Small Yapping Dogs.<br /><br />Page by page, we get to see this great mix (from dull to wacky to what-the-hee-haw?) of Alfred's possessions, neatly laid out and labeled. Sometimes the category is weird, other times the seemingly normal group contains odd items, or maybe the labels are terribly clever. In any case, you can find humor on every page, and  part of the fun is looking closely. I particularly liked the page with the packed boxes and his nutty labels, although I'm sad we don't get to see the contents of the Sticky Things box.<br /><br />I love how the book is oversized - fourteen inches tall. Big books feel like such a luxury to me, particularly when you can open this one up and have all these great big pages filled with fascinating items. It's exactly like pawing through someone's closet, with none of the embarrassment.", "images": [], "asin": "1936365820", "parent_asin": "1936365820", "user_id": "AHXJ4UDOXSEDJE2XNQB6CWBKXZQA", "timestamp": 1390737912000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Send in the clown", "text": "Although Douglas Schoen and Michael Rowan do not draw the comparison, the similarities between Venezuelan despot Hugo Chavez and Benito Mussolini are striking: Both sons of poor teachers, both master agitators, both grandiose aspirants to penny-ante empires, both meddlers in neighbors' civil wars and both buffoons.<br />Chavez is a clown, say Schoen and Rowan, but an extremely dangerous one.<br />Schoen is a public relations man with close ties to the Democratic Party, Rowan a political consultant in the United States and publicist in Venezuela.<br />Oil is -- or was -- the key to Chavez's operations. \"The Threat Closer to Home\" lays out just how extensive these are.<br />In America, Chavez is probably best known for his running insults against George Bush, which were, however, mild compared to what many Americans said about him. However, Chavez worked to back up his rants. Rowan and Schoen portray a man with a visceral hatred of America and a determination to ruin us.<br />That would be beyond his capacity, but Chavez has done and can still do a lot of damage.<br />Besides drug-running and subversion of Colombia, Chavez has imported Muslim terrorists and, say the authors, sponsors at least five Hezbollah training bases. Much about Chavez is bizarre, but the conversion of an Indian tribe to Islam, with veiled Indian women and Kalashnikov-carrying Indian men occupying a lawless land on the Colombian-Venezuelan border -- for all the world like Gaza -- is beyond weird.<br />Although the book is current up to last fall, things have happened since then. Chavez won (perhaps not honestly) his bid to become tinpot dictator for life, but the rest of the news has been all bad for him.<br />Schoen and Rowan credit Venezuela with oil output of 3 million barrels per day -- nearly half a billion dollars when oil is at $150, which it isn't. Bloomberg News, which surveys buyers, thinks it is only 2.15 million barrels, of which 800,000 are consumed at home.<br />Since oil receipts pay for everything in Venezuela, a crash cannot be far off. Its bonds are even less salable that Argentina's.<br />Presumably, Chavez's bought friends, ranging from Jimmy Carter to Sean Penn to Mahmoud Ahmadinijad, are looking for the exit.<br />Sooner or later, the United States will have to deal with this, as well as other gangster states. Modern weaponry makes them too dangerous to let live.<br />Rowan and Schoen have an attractive -- though dubiously practical -- program that they suggest the United States could follow that would not only defang Chavez and his goons but improve the lives of 550 million impoverished Latin Americans.<br />The reason their program sounds doubtful is that, certainly for Venezuela and probably for most of the other Latin governmental disasters, there is no liberal, democratic, sensible leadership class available to replace him. (Sound like Iraq? It is.)<br />As Schoen and Rowan acknowledge (although you have to read closely or you' ll miss it), Venezuela's non-communist ruling class was no better than Chavez, except that they were not anti-American. Venezuela has oil, and the only national political doctrine has been, loot the oil.<br />The notion that Latins in Latin America could raise their output to the levels of the Latins who have emigrated to the United States is alluring, but it would mean that Latin America would have to adopt a liberal political culture.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Brilliant and scarily realistic", "text": "I was enamored with this concept from the first time I heard about it - how awful would it be to know for a fact you have a higher chance of becoming a killer? I often think it's bad enough doing the cancer genetic testing, Huntington's, etc, those sorts of things, where you find out for sure you are more likely to end up suffering from that. Correlate that to this concept, and the different implications, and I was hooked before I ever picked up the book.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, I have to say, this book is maybe a bit slower. To start, it's very much about Davy figuring out how to handle suddenly being cast aside, and the echoing of so many eras in our history as a result was chilling. This is one of those books that, despite not being solid contemporary/realistic fiction, is too realistic to be comfortable. Can I imagine everything in this book actually happening? Absolutely. I really loved Davy's character. She's a good girl, a privileged girl, with so much ahead of her, at least until she's uninvited from her school as a result of being a carrier. As everything is stripped away from her, and even her own family has some tension there now, it's both painful and realistic to read. Still, there is a lot of strength to Davy as she goes through all of this, but what I loved the most is how her fear is present, even has some element of hindering her, yet she also pushes through it and doesn't let it get the best of her.<br /><br />And Sean. Oh. Sean. I love this boy, so hard. He's so determined to fight back against everything happening, even while it seems impossible to do so. He's that quiet, solid sort of guy, with mystery about him and a hard exterior, yet such a genuinely good heart inside. This boy really got to me and I want nothing more than to see him come out okay. He takes Davy under his wing so to speak, and there is definitely some romance though it's not as forefront as in Jordan's prior series. In a lot of ways, I feel like these are two people who need each other right now, who found each other at the right time, though what that means in the future I don't know.<br /><br />There is so much realism infused throughout this book, and as someone who reads more contemporary than anything, I completely love it. Still, the sci-fi bend to it is scarily believable to me, and despite that niggle in my mind that this is something not in our world, how easy it is to imagine had me both hooked and uncomfortable. This book has so many layers and is brilliant in ways I can't describe without spoiling anything, but I highly recommend it for fans of all genres.", "images": [], "asin": "0062233653", "parent_asin": "0062233653", "user_id": "AEHQ4TA5EDAKVSLLXXXUVYLFJVBA", "timestamp": 1390928513000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Soul's Journey Home", "text": "For a book written in 1984, it sure was a captivating read.  I found the story excellent.  It took me a bit of time to figure out the heaven and hell characters, but their roles in the story played out well.  I may read it again sometime soon just to get a better hold on their battle, which probably had a much deeper meaning.<br /><br />This book had just the right mix of spiritual, racial, gender, love, trust, parenthood, youth, old age, heaven and hell, and of course a Ghost.<br /><br />I'm sure that someone involved in the movie Ghost, which came out around 1990, must've read this book to get their initial idea.<br /><br />What I found interesting were the relationships of the characters.  There's much conflict and change going on in the families of the White Ghost and the little Black boy who befriends the ghost.  It takes the love between family members to bring about the success of the story.<br /><br />To have a ghost narrate to you about what it feels like to be dead does get a bit spooky.  The ghost, being a writer in his earth life, has the skill to describe his after death existence in a way the reader finds believable and captivating.  Constantly while reading this book I found myself putting my being in the ghost's position.  What if I'd died and had to watch my ex-wife and family move on with their lives without me.  Cut off from any form of contact with them.  Anger may drive you to haunt the living as you become an introverted unhappy entity without a home and no future to think of.  What would you do?<br /><br />The child's role in this book was perfect.  A child with a gift.  Reminds me of a biblical quote which says \"In order to enter the kingdom of heaven we must become as children.\"  Yes, it took a child to see what adults were unable or too busy to see.  And it took a wise old man to help prepare that child for the day when he'd need to use his special gift.<br /><br />Not a lot of excitement, or at least the type of haunting and ghostly excitement you'd expect in a book about a ghost.  It's not just your typical ghost story. It's just as much a philosophical/metaphysical journey down a mysterious path as it is a horror/ghost story.  A thinking person's ghost story maybe. The author does an excellent job in giving us one possibility of what comes after life.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention the humor written effortlessly into this story.  The author has the ghost talk intimately with the reader about his dilemma and if the reader's mind can respond to the nifty flow of dialogue, then the story becomes alive.  I really couldn't put this book down.  It was a quick 283 pages that I couldn't guess what would happen and didn't want it to end.  It would take Hollywood to screw up this story and make it something of a tear jerker.  Fortunately for the movie Ghost, it had a love story, comedy, good special effects and a great soundtrack.  Where as this book had a real ghost, a gifted child and a struggle between good and evil.
